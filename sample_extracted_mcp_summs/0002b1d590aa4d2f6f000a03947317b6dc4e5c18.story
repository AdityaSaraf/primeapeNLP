Police evidence about the links between murdered Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko and British intelligence will be heard in secret, a court was told yesterday.
Mr Litvinenko, 43, was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 allegedly while having tea with former KGB agents Andrei Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovturn at a central London hotel in 2006.
It has been claimed that both MI5 and MI6 had regular contact with the former security officer about his work in Russia.
But parts of a Scotland Yard investigation into these links will not be made public during the inquest into his death, at the Governmentâ€™s request.
