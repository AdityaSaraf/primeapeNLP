Kathleen Adair, 39, was walking her three dogs up Davies Creek Trail in Alaska on Christmas Eve when she spotted the bird with each leg shut inside traps.
Heading home, she also sprung another trap which she spotted in the ground - prompting an investigation by Alaska Wildlife Troopers that landed her in court.
'When she's hiking and she comes across an eagle in a snare, I encourage her to rescue that eagle again, and I will screen that case out as well,' the district attorney added, according to the Empire.
'But even as it was, I could tell one of the legs was just dangling, just completely broken and I knew they wouldn't be able to fix that, but I was hoping they could at least fix the other and keep it as an educational bird.'
