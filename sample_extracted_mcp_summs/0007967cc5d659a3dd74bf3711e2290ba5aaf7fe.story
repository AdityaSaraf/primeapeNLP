Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho believes Cesc Fabregas is perfectly suited to filling the position Frank Lampard occupied for 13 years.
The 27-year-old former Arsenal captain signed from Barcelona in June after Chelsea record goalscorer Lampard left under freedom of contract at the end of last season.
Fabregas scored in Chelsea's 2-1 win over Ferencvaros in Budapest on Sunday - on a day when Lampard was sitting in the stands for Manchester City after signing on loan from New York City FC - in the Blues' penultimate pre-season friendly before next Monday's Premier League opening contest at Burnley.
It is still too soon to know the full extent of the ankle injury which forced Didier Drogba off during the first half against Ferencvaros.
