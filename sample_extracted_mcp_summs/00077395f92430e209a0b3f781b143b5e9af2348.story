Some of the building applications go back to 2010, when the Government altered planning law to require every local authority to create a 'core strategy' outlining where an allotted number of new homes should be built in the coming years.
But three years after it came into operation, 178 of the country's 327 district councils still haven't managed to complete their 'core strategy' â€” temporarily giving developers carte blanche to build on almost any rural land they can buy.
I understand that Mr Shirley has not actually sold the field yet, but instead granted Charles Church Homes a legally binding 'option' to buy it, for several million pounds, provided planning permission is granted.
