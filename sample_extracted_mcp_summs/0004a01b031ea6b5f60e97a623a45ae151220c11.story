They weigh around 15 stone at birth and grow very quickly, with most calves nearly doubling in height in the first year alone.
When fully grown, the newborn, who will mingle with a group of five giraffes, which includes two pregnant giraffes, could reach 18 feet in height.
The offspring measures around six feet tall and was born at Dortmund Zoo this week to the delight of its mother, her keepers and members of the public.
