Boxing commentators roundly criticized the result while former heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis said the scoring showed that boxing had lost its integrity.
Although he recorded a comfortable victory over Brandon Rios last November, Pacquiao was knocked out for the first time since 1999 by Juan Manuel Marquez in his previous bout.
At 35, it would be difficult for Pacquiao to resurrect his career at the very highest level if defeated by Bradley for a second time but he refuses to entertain this notion ahead of the contest.

Before assaulting and killing Jennifer Hawke-Petit, Hayes forced her to go to a bank and withdraw $15,000 from an account after finding evidence that the account held between $20,000 and $30,000, authorities said.
The two daughters, who were both tied to their beds, died of smoke inhalation, while William Petit managed to escape from the basement, where he had been held.
Komisarjevsky's attorneys had asked for leniency, arguing that he had no prior history of violence, was abused as a child and had been committed to a mental hospital for depression.

The committee will prepare a timetable for the dissolution of contractors protecting development projects and submit it to President Hamid Karzai by November 15, the Afghan government said.
The announcement was welcomed by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, which issued a statement saying it supports the "principled stand" of Karzai's government regarding the proposed ban.
Eikenberry said earlier in a statement the United States "strongly endorses" the United Nations' position.
The United States had previously expressed concern about Karzai's pledge to phase out the country's 52 private security companies by year's end, saying that if implemented, the move would leave critical aid personnel unprotected and unable to continue their work.
The United States has been negotiating with the Afghan government over such protection, and had been asking for clarification on which contractors would be allowed to remain in the country and under what conditions they could operate.

Scientists can use brain signals to control computers -- hands free.
In the past year, researchers have developed technology that makes it possible to use thoughts to operate a computer, maneuver a wheelchair or even use Twitter -- all without lifting a finger.
But as neural devices become more complicated, and go wireless, some scientists say the risks of "brain hacking" should be taken seriously.
"These kinds of security issues have to proceed in lockstep with the technology," Williams said.
"Because the Internet was not originally designed with security in mind," the researchers wrote, "it is incredibly challenging -- if not impossible -- to retrofit the existing Internet infrastructure to meet all of today's security goals." Kohno and his colleagues hope to avoid such problems in the neural device world, by getting the community to discuss potential security problems before they become a reality.

First up were some energetic feathertail gliders – the world’s smallest gliding possums which are around the size of a field mouse and move just as quickly, making them quite a handful as some guests quickly realised as they tried to clamper up arm sleeves and jump on to people’s faces.

Lightning, on average, kills more people than hurricanes and tornadoes combined (among all weather-related fatalities, only floods kill more).
No deaths have occurred in the Northeast so far, "likely due to the cool, damp pattern we've seen in New England," Jensensius said.
According to the National Weather Service, "each spark of lightning can reach over five miles in length, soar to temperatures of approximately 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit and contain 100 million electrical volts."

A village of just 1,000 residents in Switzerland has been forced to raise taxes because an African refugee and her seven children cost the local authority £40,000 in benefits every month.
Hagenbuch, in the Swiss canton of Zurich, is understood to be spending close to a third of its total annual budget on the family after they arrived from Eritrea in East Africa three years ago.
Outraged: Hagenbuch (pictured), in the Swiss canton of Zurich, is understood to be spending close to a third of its total annual budget on the family after they arrived from Eritrea in East Africa three years ago
The Eritrean woman and her family arrived in Hagenbuch three years ago in possession of a visa allowing her to stay in Switzerland for five years, with the option to extend her stay beyond that date.
When the woman and her family arrived in Hagenbuch three years ago, the municipal government immediately agreed to cover the full cost of their rent and £1,700 a month in living expenses.
This resulted in four of them being sent to an orphanage - with the local authority paying out £6,000 for each child every month - a total cost of £24,000.

Obama is preparing for a prime-time televised speech in which he will spell out a long-awaited strategy to confront ISIS, a brutal terror network that has captured huge swathes of Iraq and Syria and published depraved videos showing its fighters beheading American journalists.
The United States military has already launched targeted strikes against the group's positions in Iraq, but has yet to strike at their strongholds in Syria, where the extremists are also fighting soldiers from the regime of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.
Obama told congressional leaders on Tuesday that he has the authority he needs to broaden his military campaign into Syria, striking ISIS in its stronghold despite objections from Assad.
A source familiar with the president's plans told CBS News on Wednesday that Obama would 'eventually' strike Syria, but analysts have not finished identifying targets there.
Hours before Obama met with senior Capitol Hill leaders, former Vice President Dick Cheney told House GOP stalwarts in the National Republican Congressional Committee that they need to stand strong in the age of ISIS against the Obama administration's efforts to pare back military spending.
The package could also include a $500 million fund to arm Syrian rebels groups in their fight against ISIS, which was suggested earlier this year but has yet to be approved.

Lord Justice Moore-Bick ruled the public interest in the Chinese man's crimes outweighed his children's right to family life
It is the first case to come to light since Theresa May changed the law earlier this year to state that Article 8 should  prevent deportation of criminals with jail sentences of more than four years only in the most ‘exceptional cases’.
The man, who for legal reasons can be identified only as LC, was sentenced to five years in jail in July 2010 – prompting Mrs May to make an order for his removal back to China.
It is the first case to come to light since Theresa May changed the law earlier this year to state that Article 8 should apply only in the most ‘exceptional cases’
The rules state that, if a foreign criminal has been sentenced to less than four years in jail, they should be removed unless there are ‘exceptional’ family reasons not to do so.
In cases such as LC, who was sentenced to more than four years, the rules become stricter.
But ministers will hope that – finally – judges have got the message that Article 8 should not be cited as a bar to removal.

Abstractive Summary:
Chinese national was convicted of robbing two young women in their flat
He was sentenced to five years imprisonment and told to face deportation
He fought ruling claiming it infringed on his British children's human rights
Being sent back to China 'would violate their right to respect of family life'
Court of Appeal ruled his crime 'outweighed' his children's nationality
An earlier version of this article said that this is the first case to come to light since Theresa May changed the law earlier this year to state that Article 8 should apply only in the most ‘exceptional cases’.

Second Model with 0 correct:
The child of a deportee will not normally be deported if they live with their other parent his mother or father are living apart from the deportee, they have left home and become independent, or they are married before deportation comes into prospect.
The only way a convict can avoid removal is to show there were ‘exceptional circumstances justifying his remaining in the UK which outweigh the public interest in his removal’.
Lord Justice Moore-Bick, vice-president of the civil section of the Court of Appeal, said the man’s children – a son aged six and daughter aged three – were not required to leave Britain and could be cared for by their mother, who is claiming benefits.
In 2012, exasperated at the abuse of Article 8 of Labour’s Human Rights Act, Theresa May issued new guidance to judges, saying serious foreign criminals should normally be kicked out.
LC could potentially lodge an appeal to the Supreme Court or European Court in Strasbourg, though lawyers would face an uphill task persuading either to hear the case, given the firmness of the Appeal Court’s judgment.
This cannot be interfered with by a public authority except if done so legally and deemed necessary in the interests of national security, public safety, the economic well being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

Wearing colourful baggy trousers , and smiling widely behind his face paint , Bozo the clown appears in front of a group of school children and cries : &apos; Do you want to play ? &apos;
He looks just like an innocent entertainer but second later &apos; Bozo &apos; screeches like a maniac and - as the pupils flee in horror - chases them into a nearby park brandishing a gun and a sharpened stick .
This is no Halloween prank , but the face of a disturbing new trend sweeping America and Europe : clown terror attacks inspired by US serial killer Twisty the Clown .

Last year Northampton became the focus of a clown craze when budding filmmaker Alex Powell dressed as a clown and posted pictures of himself on Facebook.
Teenager Thomas Van Becelaert, who now has a criminal conviction for premeditated violence with a weapon, marauded through the town of Douvrin, northern France.
Armed: At a court appearance Thomas Van Becelaert confessed to carrying an air pistol that looked like a live ammunition gun to target children
The sinister movement started in the US, mainly thanks to TV series called ‘American Horror Story: Freak Show’, which centres on the serial killer Twisty the Clown.
Now however it has spread to Europe, where police in France have been forced to issue a warning against vigilante mobs, stating: 'Any person, aggressive clowns or hunters of clowns, discovered in possession of a weapon on the highway will be arrested.'

(CNN) -- In a headline that calls out for attention -- "A Gender Reversal on Career Aspirations" -- the Pew Research Center reports that two-thirds of young women now say "being successful in a high-paying career or profession" is one of the most important goals in their lives.
Children are even more desired, with 95% of young women and 90% of young men placing "being a good parent" in these same categories.
Yet young people's actions, at least when it comes to family commitments, appear at odds with these stated aspirations.
The gap between young women's high aspirations -- for relationships and parenthood along with paid work -- and their increasing tendency to remain "on their own" suggest that they are hardly naive.
An egalitarian partnership may be the ideal, but most young women see self-reliance through paid work as essential to their survival, offering the option to choose the right relationship, maintain a measure of autonomy within it and go it alone if nothing better comes along.
But as long as careers require unfettered, constant devotion and caretaking remains undervalued, privatized and penalized, the goal of striking their desired balance between paid work and the rest of life will remain illusive for young women and men alike.

An egalitarian partnership may be the ideal, but most young women see self-reliance through paid work as essential to their survival, offering the option to choose the right relationship, maintain a measure of autonomy within it and go it alone if nothing better comes along.
In fact, earlier Pew surveys found 73% of Americans believe that women's employment has been a "change for the better," while 62% say that sharing the responsibilities of paid work and rearing children is "more satisfying than a more traditional marriage."
But as long as careers require unfettered, constant devotion and caretaking remains undervalued, privatized and penalized, the goal of striking their desired balance between paid work and the rest of life will remain illusive for young women and men alike.

‘This individual should not have been allowed to board his flight, and it is unacceptable that CATSA waited four days before seeking the RCMP’s assistance,’ Transport Minister Lisa Raitt told the National Post.
Mr Larocque declined to comment further about the incident, saying only that ‘for security reasons, I can’t go into details about our procedures at the checkpoint, which include our protocols with the police.’
Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the judge in Mr Murphy's case say they believe him bringing the bomb to the airport was an accident based on how shocked he was in surveillance video, the CBC reported.
Black powder and a pipe bomb were found in Mr Murphy’s luggage by Canadian Air Transport Security Authority screeners, but they did not detain him or immediately alert authorities because they are not permitted to, according to a CATSA official.

A rare picture of Charles Miller, the British gentleman who arrived in Brazil in 1894 with a football under each arm and introduced the country to the sport
A Scotsman arrives in a Brazilian port with a football under each arm, attracting quizzical looks from the locals who wonder what the spherical objects are for.
Today, as Brazilian fans eagerly anticipate their country’s bid for a sixth World Cup win – this time on home soil – there is little any country, far less Scotland, can teach them about football.
Coincidentally, he began playing the game in Sao Paulo at the same time another Scot, Glasgow-born factory worker Thomas Donohoe, was helping to popularise it in Rio de Janeiro.
A statue was unveiled there last year to honour Donohoe’s role but historians now agree Miller was the first to organise a match played under Association Football rules in Brazil.

On April 14, 1895, on a scrubby field on the floodplains of a river in central Sao Paulo – after some cattle were moved out of the way – Miller played in the first full football match on Brazilian soil.
What began in Brazil as a game for the white elite and impeccably dressed supporters who greeted every goal with cries of ‘hip hip hurray’ became a game for the masses.
When Miller, pictured left with his Sau Paulo team and right with a Hampshire XI, finished school, he had scored a remarkable 45 goals in 34 matches in his latest season and was widely expected to turn professional
The man who stepped off the boat in Santos in 1894 was Charles Miller, son of a Greenock boatyard clerk who had left his home town to build a new life in South America.
In 1901, the country’s first league was founded in Sao Paulo and at its conclusion Miller’s Sao Paulo Athletic Club – a team of expats – and Paulistano, made up entirely of Brazilians, were tied.

The report has sparked fresh calls for a full independent inquiry into the computer system used by postmasters after the report reported concerns that ‘in some circumstances Horizon can be systemically flawed’.
Former Conservative MP James Arbuthnot, who led an MPs’ campaign to support the subpostmasters, said: ‘These people have been pillars of the community who had their reputations dragged through the mud – some have been sent to prison, they’ve been made bankrupt, they’ve had contracts terminated, I understand at least one has committed suicide.

(CNN) -- As Britain continues to celebrate Andy Murray's Wimbledon title, things aren't going quite as well for Roger Federer.
The Swiss dropped from third to fifth in the aftermath of his upset loss in the second round to Sergiy Stakhovsky at Wimbledon, matching the ranking he last held in June 2003 when he wasn't yet a grand slam winner.
While Federer frets over his drop in the rankings, man of the moment Murray is very much on the up.
He has now captured two of the last three grand slam tournaments he has competed in and replaced Federer as the world's best grass court player, having also claimed Olympic gold at Wimbledon in 2012 and a Wimbledon warm-up in London last month.
"Under pressure right now Andy has two majors and a gold medal," his coach Ivan Lendl told British newspaper the Telegraph as he reflected on Murray's Wimbledon victory over Novak Djokovic on Sunday.

After drawing the first leg 2-2 at Old Trafford, Porto only needed a low-scoring draw to reach the last four, but in truth they never looked threatening against a United defense superbly marshalled by Nemanja Vidic and the returning Rio Ferdinand.
In fact, had Vidic been able to keep his close-range effort under the crossbar after John O'Shea had got the faintest of touches to a Ryan Giggs corner just before the interval, United would surely have completed their task in the first 45 minutes.

So he ordered the creation of some 8,000 terra-cotta soldiers , along with hundreds of terra-cotta horses and chariots , to be buried with him in his tomb .
When the statues were discovered by workers digging a well in Xi &apos;an , Shaanxi Province , in 1974 , the world was stunned by the spectacular funerary art and the legacy of the powerful emperor .

Then, working with local craftsmen in Xi'an, 108 permutations of statues were made based Nourry's original eight statues by combining the different heads, torsos and legs.
"For Xian Feng, the main craftsman I worked with in China, my project seemed at first impossible since women 'can't be soldiers.' But after we began the project, he changed his view and even turned one of the 108 combinations into a portrait of his own daughter," said Nourry.
The difference is these female terra-cotta warriors are not out to protect any emperor, but were created to bring attention to the plight of girls in China.
After the exhibition, they will be buried in China until 2030, the year that, according to Chinese sociologists, men will have the hardest time finding a wife because of the skewed gender ratio.

Commissioner John Spatz of Chicago's Department of Water Management said the north branch of the Chicago River "rose quickly and began to flow down the 5000 block of North Monticello," causing flooding northward and southward.
About 90 billion gallons of water fell on the city's water district, authorities said.
Spatz said the city's sewer system was still "working well."

(CNN) -- Taliban militants, who implemented Islamic law in Pakistan's violence-plagued Swat Valley last week, have now taken control of a neighboring district.
Swat Valley is located in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, near the border with Afghanistan and about 185 miles (300 kilometers) from the Pakistani capital of Islamabad.
The alpine region once was one of Pakistan's premier tourist destinations, boasting the nation's only ski resort until it was shut down after Taliban militants overran the area.
This week, the Taliban moved to seize control of the neighboring Buner district, bringing it closer to Islamabad than it has been since Taliban insurgency began.

Danny Cipriani is among England's fringe players who must get a start in the remaining Six Nations games
Stuart Lancaster's focus must shift to the World Cup with two competitive matches left before it starts
With two games to go in the Six Nations, England’s momentum going into the World Cup camp depends on their performances against Scotland and France.
England's squad are put through their paces ahead of Saturday's Six Nations clash with Scotland
There are three men Lancaster still needs to see start - Danny Cipriani, Steffon Armitage and Henry Slade.
Also, if he gets injured in the first minute at the World Cup, nobody knows who will replace him as captain.
The current back row of Robshaw, Haskell and Billy Vunipola is not quick enough at the very top level.
Dave Alred (right) not only helped Jonny Wilkinson's prodigious kicking but the all-round England game
Every player picked should be fit enough to play for 80 minutes if they're worthy of the World Cup

The current back row of Robshaw, Haskell and Billy Vunipola is not quick enough at the very top level.
It may not have changed the outcome, but I’d love to have seen Ford, Cipriani and Joseph finish that game together.
Slade - alongside Jonathan Joseph - is perhaps the most in-form centre in England and his left foot, at inside centre, would offer more kicking variations.
Assuming all your players can last 80 minutes, the first purpose of your bench should be for injury replacements, but England started against Ireland with no specialist second-row substitute.
If Dave Attwood had gone off in the first minute, could Nick Easter really play the whole game in the second row?

(CNN) -- Memorial Day weekend has, over the years, turned in large part into something it was not originally intended to be:
The weather is turning warm, there's a holiday feel to the break from work, and the solemnity and grieving for those who gave their lives in the pursuit of peace seems to sometimes get pushed aside.
But it is that pursuit of peace, with all its contradictions and all its sacrifices, that remains the centerpiece of Memorial Day.
And this weekend it might be worth pausing, if only for a moment, to reflect upon a quotation that has variously been attributed to Winston Churchill and to George Orwell:
It is perfectly explicable that we much prefer bathing ourselves in exuberant images of the first hours of peace, rather than the gruesome images of the last hours of war.
When the day came, he didn't delegate; he flew the B-29 named Enola Gay -- his mother's name -- to Hiroshima with one goal in mind: to make the war stop.
To let the soldiers, sailors, aviators and Marines go home at last, to rejoin their families or start new families, to somehow, after all the suffering and all the heartbreak, find peace.

What Paul Tibbets, navigator Dutch Van Kirk, bombardier Tom Ferebee and their crew were asked to do over the skies of Japan is something that is difficult for many people to think about; it's much more pleasant to smile at the sight of the kiss in New York.

(CNN) -- Brazilian public notary Claudia do Nascimento Domingues set off a firestorm by granting Brazil's first civil union to a trio, an act so unprecedented that there isn't a word for it in Portuguese.
The relationship involves three professionals in their 30s -- one man and two women -- who, she says, live together, love one another as equals and are like any other non-married cohabiting couple -- except they are three.
What Domingues did was legally register the trio as a "stable union," a civil union that extends all of the benefits of marriage, though there is debate about what rights the threesome will actually enjoy.
Brazilian law defines marriage as a union between two people, so it is impossible for a civil union of three to be granted the rights of a marriage of two.
The country's supreme court ruled that a gay couple in a civil union had the same rights as a married heterosexual couple, but there is debate about whether such rights can be extended to a trio.

The controversial civil union "is proof that there is a plurality of familiar relations, though not all deserve judicial or legal standing," Rolf Madaleno, director of the Brazilian Institute for Family Law, said in a statement.
The trio from Rio, having been rejected by other public notaries, found their way rural Sao Paulo state and to Domingues because she is a student of polyfidelitous relationships -- ones involving more than two partners, but where there is fidelity between the members.
But to Domingues, a public notary in the city of Tupa in Sao Paulo state, there is nothing preventing nontraditional relationships from being granted "stable union" status.
"The institution of family cannot be defended with the approval of actions that seek to distort its definition," the religious, conservative Plinio Correa de Oliveira Institute said in a statement.

Scientists were prompted to investigate after noting a growing number of reports of people in Cuba suffering a rapid progression to AIDS, within three years of infection.
Experts say the new strain, identified in Cuba, causes patients to progress to AIDS within three years - so rapidly they may not even realise they have been infected.
'All patients infected with CRF19 were progressing to AIDS within three years after being infected - often as soon as they were diagnosed with HIV infection.
In those patients infected with the new strain of HIV, researchers found abnormally high doses of the virus, and of a defensive molecule known as RANTES.
Their finding that all study patients who were infected with the new HIV variant, went on to develop AIDS within three years of infection supports the theory.

In March 2013, two men posing as tourists commandeered a helicopter from a Canadian tour company, ordered the pilot to fly over a detention center near Montreal, hoisted two inmates into the hovering aircraft using cables -- and zipped away.
It was a real "James Bond moment," witness Francis Emond said about last year's escape from the facility in Saint-Jerome, northwest of Montreal.

Chase Loney, 3, of Prior Lake, Minnesota, was with his parents last August when he was attacked in his neighbors' living room.
He required 22 stitches, and an agreement was worked out that the neighbors would pay for medical costs and get rid of the dog, and no legal action would be taken.
The young boy's parents said they would not seek legal action if the neighbors got rid of the dog
'We gave our neighbors the option to pay the medical bills and get rid of the dog, and we'll leave it alone,' said Chase's mom, Chandra Loney.
Now, she is concerned the dog might attack other children in the neighborhood.

But as the  blame game escalated today, former Labour treasury minister Lord Myners took aim at Gordon Brown, claiming the former PM who gave him a job in government 'got it wrong' on opposing tougher rules in the City.
The Government’s Commission on Banking Standards examined the roles played by former HBoS chairman Lord Stevenson and former chief executives Sir James Crosby and Andy Hornby, and its damning report today accuses them of presiding over a lending spree which led to the bank’s downfall at the height of the financial crisis in 2008.
When banks became too scared to lend to each other during the financial crisis in 2008, HBoS – saddled with £238billion of debt – had to be rescued by Lloyds.
All three men at the top of the company have moved on to lucrative positions since leaving HBoS, but the commission found their actions so ‘deluded’ it has called on the City watchdog to consider banning them from working in the financial sector ever again.
It also singled out former chairman Lord Stevenson as being ‘incapable of facing up to the reality of what placed the bank in jeopardy’.
Last night critics also called for Lord Stevenson and Sir James Crosby to be stripped of their honours, after former Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Fred Goodwin was relieved of his knighthood last year.
Paul Moore, the former head of risk at HBoS who was sacked in 2004 shortly after he raised the alarm on its reckless lending, said: ‘These former bosses have been proved to be incompetent and willfully reckless, maybe even dishonest.
Under scrutiny: The report examined the role played in the HBoS collapse by former chairman Lord Stevenson, left, and former chief executives Andy Hornby, right, and Sir James Crosby
The City watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, is also slammed by the Commission for ‘box ticking’ and failing to prevent the collapse of HBoS, despite warning the lender’s board in 2004 that it was ‘an accident waiting to happen’.

Shareholders, including pension savers, have seen their investments wiped out, while more than 35,000 staff at Lloyds and HBoS have lost their jobs since the bailout in 2008.
Stevenson also accuses the Financial Services Authority of being ‘paranoid’ about the health of HBoS, adding on March 17, 2008, just months before the lender’s collapse: ‘My soberly considered view is that given the extraordinary external environment, HBoS in an admittedly uncertain and worrying world is in as secure a position as it could be.’
Paul Moore, the former head of risk at HBoS who was sacked in 2004 shortly after he raised the alarm on its reckless lending, said: ‘These former bosses have been proved to be incompetent and willfully reckless, maybe even dishonest.
The Cambridge-educated peer, who once described himself as ‘an unreconstructed 1960s Guardian-reading liberal’ and an ‘intellectual snob’, received £815,000 in annual pay and perks at HBoS.
Since leaving HBoS after it was rescued by Lloyds, Stevenson has worked for a private equity firm and he recently quit as a non-executive directorship of a venture capital firm based in tax haven Guernsey.

Like Northern Rock, HBoS – created in 2001 by a merger of Halifax and Bank of Scotland – fell to the brink of collapse after relying on risky short-term loans from other banks to fuel its own lending to customers.
'Gordon Brown was wrong in what he said; his judgement has proven to be wrong, and I’ll put my hand up and say that I was with the consensus in thinking that the City was doing probably quite a good job,' he told BBC Radio 5Live.

A coroner called for a review of powerboat training after a jury yesterday ruled that the deaths of a TV executive and his daughter were both accidents.
Nick Milligan, 51, and his eight year old daughter Emily were killed when his out of control speedboat hit them after they were thrown into the water following a high speed turn.
At the end of a two-day inquest into both deaths, the senior coroner for Cornwall Dr Emma Carlyon said she will write to the Royal Yachting Association to ask if it is ‘appropriate to review the advice for the level of training required for powerboats.’
Nick Milligan (left), 51, and his eight-year-old daughter Emily (right) were killed when his out of control speedboat hit them after they were thrown into the water following a high speed turn.
Her call followed an emotional plea from Mr Milligan’s older brother Brigadier Mark Milligan for safety lessons to be learnt from the tragedy, during which Nick’s wife Victoria and the couple’s other three children were also flung into the water as the 300 horsepower craft raced round in circles inflicting terrible injuries on the family.
Nick Milligan and his family, from Wandsworth, South West London, were spending the weekend in their holiday home near St Endoc, Cornwall, when the Bank Holiday tragedy happened around 3.45pm on Sunday May 5 last year.
After completing several laps of the picturesque Camel Estuary north of Padstow at around 30 knots - or roughly 30 mph - in the rigid inflatable boat, called Milly, Mr Milligan took off the ‘kill cord’, which links the wearer’s leg to the ignition and cuts the engine if they fall overboard, because he needed ‘a wee’ as they headed back to shore, the inquest heard.
Mrs Milligan then took the helm but did not attach the device.
Mr and Mrs Milligan had each undertaken a powerboat training course run by the Royal Yachting Association.
Tragedy: Nick Milligan, 51, and his eight-year-old daughter Emily (left) were in a speedboat with the rest of the family, Victoria and children (left to right) Olivia, Kit and Amber, when they were thrown from the boat and hit by the out of control vessel as it continued to circle in the water

Nick Milligan and his family, from Wandsworth, South West London, were spending the weekend in their holiday home near St Endoc, Cornwall, when the Bank Holiday tragedy happened around 3.45pm on Sunday May 5 last year.
At the end of a two-day inquest into both deaths, the senior coroner for Cornwall Dr Emma Carlyon said she will write to the Royal Yachting Association to ask if it is ‘appropriate to review the advice for the level of training required for powerboats.’
After completing several laps of the picturesque Camel Estuary north of Padstow at around 30 knots - or roughly 30 mph - in the rigid inflatable boat, called Milly, Mr Milligan took off the ‘kill cord’, which links the wearer’s leg to the ignition and cuts the engine if they fall overboard, because he needed ‘a wee’ as they headed back to shore, the inquest heard.
Her call followed an emotional plea from Mr Milligan’s older brother Brigadier Mark Milligan for safety lessons to be learnt from the tragedy, during which Nick’s wife Victoria and the couple’s other three children were also flung into the water as the 300 horsepower craft raced round in circles inflicting terrible injuries on the family.
Yesterday Susan Mann, a doctor who happened to be on a trip on another boat, said Mrs Milligan, whose leg was severed below the knee with the bone and tissue exposed, said, ‘My life is ruined’ and kept asking where her husband was as she tended to her after she was dragged from the water with Kit by a kayaker.
She did not think there was enough room to turn, but her husband, managing director of Sky’s advertising sales division Sky Media, ‘grabbed the wheel with his right hand and accelerated with his left hand’, she said.
Yesterday naval architect Lorne Campbell, who examined the boat for the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) after the tragedy, said an ‘error of judgement’ may have led to Mr Milligan pushing the throttle harder than anticipated.
But the MAIB report found the couple were unprepared for the boat’s reaction when it was turned at speed and then ‘hooked’ - the nautical equivalent of a car spinning - as they did not have the level of boat handling skills required to control such a turn.

In their natural state, the barrier islands that line about half of the U.S.
During Superstorm Sandy, broad swaths of the coastline from North Carolina to Massachusetts experienced dune failure and massive overwash.
The sand washed onto and across the barrier islands, filling roads, yards and living rooms.
As the army of bulldozers and other earth-moving equipment deployed along the coast suggests, current efforts appear headed to restore the islands to their pre-storm state.
We can either try to thwart the natural response -- requiring increasing investment in construction and maintenance of storm protection structures -- or adapt by relocating farther away from the beachfront and upward as the barrier islands move.

Cairo (CNN) -- Hundreds of demonstrators extended their sit-in outside Egypt's defense ministry to a sixth day Thursday, as organizers called for mass protests following violence that killed at least 11 people.
The protests come against a backdrop of frustration over the pace of reform since Hosni Mubarak was ousted as president last year and amid concern that Egypt's military leadership is delaying the transition to civilian rule.
Alistair Burt, UK Foreign Office Minister for the Middle East and North Africa, said Thursday he was deeply concerned by the recent bloodshed and called on all sides to show restraint.
"Such unrest reinforces the need to make progress on the transition to civilian rule, through a transparent and inclusive process which allows all voices to be heard, to the timetable already agreed by the Egyptian authorities."
The Freedom and Justice Party, the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood, issued a statement Thursday blaming the Supreme Council for the death and injuries in the Abaseya clashes, saying it wanted to delay the transition of power.

Subway Tokyo has an incredibly efficient subway, but the 13 lines are run by two different companies, Toei Subways and Tokyo Metro, meaning a bewildering variety of day passes are available.
100 Yen shops These bargain stores are hugely popular in Tokyo, selling everything from food to toiletries for ¥100 plus ¥5 tax -- about $1.
Credit cards are still not accepted as widely as you might expect, so travelers' checks are your best bet -- and make sure you're carrying cash if you're planning a night out away from the city center.

It's not only a trade because when the oud is not made properly or the sound coming out of it is not right we become emotionally depressed."

Crime scene: Armed officers shot a 40-year-old man dead in Shepperton Road (pictured) in Islington after he broke into a house and threatened a woman with a knife
Police had sent a negotiator and armed officers to the scene at 11.19pm yesterday following reports the man had broken into a house
Police and paramedics immediately tried to resuscitate the man but he died 20 minutes later on his way to hospital.
The man and woman involved are believed to have known each other, police said, and there was not believed to be anybody else in the house at the time
The incident unfolded on Shepperton Road in Islington, London, which is lined with pretty Georgian houses
Officers arrived to discover he was armed with a knife and apparently holding the woman hostage inside.
Neighbours heard the woman screaming repeatedly and refusing to allow police inside as the man swore and shouted ‘stop pointing that light at me’ at police.
The Met's Directorate of Professional Standards were informed of the incident 'immediately' and attended the scene, a police spokesman said
At 1am – after a period of relative quiet – a volley of up to five gunshots, ‘like fireworks’, was heard as armed officers stormed inside.
Deadly force: A number of shots were fired during the incident at around 1am and the 40-year-old knifeman died 20 minutes later while on route to the hospital
She is believed to be a 56-year-old mother-of-two who moved into the local authority flat six months ago.
Commander Neil Basu, of the Met, said the shooting will be investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission and professional standards officers.

Britain's biggest out-of-hours care provider is using senior nurses to cover up to a quarter of a million patients when they cannot recruit GPs to do the shifts.

Harmoni has admitted they are used to cover out-of-hours shifts elsewhere in the country when it is unable to find doctors.
The whistleblower said many family doctors no longer volunteered to work out-of-hours shifts for Harmoni because of the intense workload.
The whistleblower said Harmoni assumed the English-speaking abilities of foreign doctors had been tested by the NHS trust.
Last year, according to the whistleblower, a man dying of cancer waited eight hours for a doctor to give him pain relief.
A spokesman for Harmoni said: ‘On very rare occasions, and only after consultation and agreement with our commissioning colleagues in North Somerset that the service remained clinically safe, we have run an overnight shift with a very experienced advanced nurse practitioner providing the first point of contact with a GP available on-call to support with any advice needed.’
When asked if this happened elsewhere in the country, Harmoni added: ‘Advanced nurse practitioners do have certain limitations on the care they can provide such as with very young children and palliative care.

But it wasn’t until after Ride's death in July 2012, following a 17-month battle with pancreatic cancer, that the world – and most people who knew her – discovered that she had been living with a woman for 27 years.
Ride’s sexuality is one of number of secrets revealed in a new book, Sally Ride: America’s First Woman In Space, written by former ABC News correspondent Lynn Sherr.
The biography also explores the chronic shyness that caused Ride to seek psychiatric help amid the overwhelming public attention that surrounded her return from space in 1983.
Sally Ride, left, and Tam O-Shaughnessy were lovers for 27 years even though many of Ride's friends only discovered she was a lesbian after her death in 2012.

Ride left NASA in 1987 and in 2001 she co-founded the Sally Ride Science, a program aimed at encouraging young girls to explore science, along with her partner
She was chosen to join NASA in 1978 and while she excelled at her work, her 'fiercely private' nature meant she struggled with the media attention that descended upon her after she was selected as America’s first female astronaut.
Despite rumors that NASA had put pressure on Ride to marry ahead of her maiden space flight, her ex-husband denies it.
The mission went off without a hitch, but the problems for Ride started when she returned to earth to discover that everybody wanted a piece of her.
But as an introvert, Ride felt traumatized by all the public attention and confided in O'Shaughnessy that she felt she was ‘losing her equilibrium.’

She was chosen to join NASA in 1978 and while she excelled at her work, her 'fiercely private' nature meant she struggled with the media attention that descended upon her after she was selected as America’s first female astronaut.
During press conferences, she was asked questions like, ‘Will the flight affect your reproductive organs?’ and ‘Do you weep when things go wrong on the job?’
Ride left NASA in 1987 and in 2001 she co-founded the Sally Ride Science, a program aimed at encouraging young girls to explore science, along with her partner
The couple were good friends with Billie Jean King, who was outed in 1981, although the former tennis star tells Sherr that Ride never asked what effect coming out had had on King's career.
Sherr describes her as a 'resolutely guarded' person and writes that ‘while Tam (O'Shaughnessy) kept nothing from her best buddies, Sally told no one, not even the insiders.’
On June 18, 1983, Ride, then 32, became the first American woman in space as a crew member on space shuttle Challenger for STS-7

Demonstration: Students on November 18, 2011 protested a tuition hike at the public university
The payout will settle the suit, filed in February, by students who participated in a demonstration on November 18, 2011 to protest a tuition hike at the public university.
The event was one among many protests nationwide that were staged after the launch of the Occupy Wall Street movement, that kicked off in New York last September.
The settlement, totaling $1 million, was approved on September 13, at a closed meeting of the University of California Regents in San Francisco, according to The Sacramento Bee.
The students who were hit with the pepper spray will also be eligible to receive support and counseling for 'academic performance issues that allegedly arose' from the clash.
'What we’re trying to achieve for this case is to make sure that the university improves its policies, training and its procedures to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again and that [UC Davis] is an institution that doesn’t just tolerate free speech but realizes the importance of free speech to a university environment and to our political system,' Michael Risher, an attorney for a plaintiff in the suit, told The California Aggie school newspaper in August.
Another protester, Ian Lee, now a sophomore, said 'I felt like the university silenced me.'

Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari praised Pakistani police, saying the officers "rose to the occasion and laid down their lives to protect our Sri Lankan guests." He also telephoned Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa to express his condemnation and regrets, and to emphasize his determination to investigate.
But Sri Lanka -- a country enduring its own civil war with separatist rebels -- agreed in December to visit for a series of matches, after the Indian cricket team called off its tour following the deadly terror attacks in Mumbai in November.
The brazen daylight attack sent shock waves across the cricket-crazy region and raised fears about the future of world cricket matches in Pakistan, which has been reeling from a string of terrorist attacks.

A childhood friend of a Utah doctor charged with killing his ex-wife testified on Wednesday that John Brickman Wall blamed the woman for ruining his life.
Klaus Fiebig said he spoke to his old friend several months before her death, and the pediatrician seemed centered around his hate for ex-wife Uta von Schwedler.
Von Schwedler, a 49-year-old cancer researcher, was found dead in a bathtub full of cold water in September 2011.
A medical examiner found that she drowned, but she also had a fatal dose of anti-anxiety medication in her system.
The day she was found, Wall came into work with a bloodied eyeball and scratches on his face, his former office manager testified Wednesday.
Prosecutors allege the 51-year-old Wall killed his ex-wife during a bitter custody battle.

Chancellor George Osborne is expected to announce the radical plan, which will see all NHS funding devolved from Westminster to the region, later this week.
It is part of the creation of a powerful new body covering the whole of Greater Manchester, but critics warn that a time of intense pressure on NHS budgets it could be a 'poisoned chalice' for the region.'
In a surprise move the transfer of NHS funding to 10 local councils would happen very quickly, taking effect from April next year.
It's also about giving Greater Manchester more control over things run in Greater Manchester - which is what our vision of a northern powerhouse is all about.
While this new model won't necessarily be right for many other parts of England, for Greater Manchester the time is right and conditions are right for shared success.'
The post of police and crime commissioner for Greater Manchester Police - established by the coalition Government - will also be scrapped in favour of the new mayor.

Hospitals across Greater Manchester, including Stepping Hill hospital in Stockport, could be funded locally under radical plans to devolve health spending
Richard Humphries, assistant director of the King's Fund think tank, said that a full transfer of responsibility would be a reform 'on a breathtaking scale' but could pose serious risks.
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Depending on the detail - and the detail is really crucial and we don't have that yet - you could either see this as a triumph for local democracy or creating real risks of yet another reorganisation of the NHS when it's barely recovered from the last one.'
Chancellor George Osborne said today: 'We're discussing a plan for bringing together the NHS and social care in Manchester so we provide better care for patients.
The region has already accepted the creation of a powerful 'metro mayor' in return for taking over responsibility for transport, skills and housebuilding and the right to recoup some money generated by growth.

And now during the Biennale contemporary artworks and installations are scattered around the city.
Here the Biennale theme of Modernity extends into a scientific narrative, looking at possible ways of existence on the Antarctic continent, a subject in total contrast to the surrounding architectural heritage in Venice.
This art installation, titled "Forever" by Ai Weiwei is part of the exhibition Genius Loci, brought to Venice by the Lisson Gallery.
There is a sense of play with architecture and space, exploring the parallels between the two disciplines, such as Anish Kapoor's work which deals with our spatial perceptions.

However, even without being able to determine Khobragade's guilt or innocence with respect to the charges, l'affaire Khobragade shines an unflattering light on several elements of India's diplomacy and its politics of privilege.
In addition to the Indian government's extremely provocative steps, the treatment of the case by most of the Indian media has also shown a substantial moral blind spot: Few members of either the commentariat or the political class, neither of whom were short on outrage over Khobragade's treatment, seemed to evince much sympathy for the maid in question, who, if prosecutors are believed, has been the victim of a crime, not the perpetrator of one.
Indian politicians play frequent lip service to the "aam admi" or common man, but the Indian press is daily filled with accounts of horrific mistreatment meted out by upper-class Indians against India's "common citizens" (for example, just last month a member of India's parliament was arrested for beating a servant to death -- allegedly over the quality of her dusting).
In that context, it is worth noting that this is not the first recent case of alleged abuse of domestic servants at India's New York Consulate.
In 2011, a member of the household staff sued India's consul general in New York, accusing him of forced labor.
But no matter what the result in the court of law, the case shines a disturbing light on the politics of privilege in India -- and on the ability of the Indian government to conduct diplomacy befitting a great power, one that seeks to ease tensions with allies over disagreements rather than needlessly inflaming them.

( CNN ) -- India and the United States have become embroiled in a full-scale diplomatic row involving the case of Devyani Khobragade , an Indian diplomat who was arrested last week and charged with visa fraud by U.S .
While the courts will eventually resolve the welter of claims and counterclaims -- even the most basic facts in the case are currently in dispute and the diplomat &apos;s attorney says the charges are false -- it is clear that this arrest was the result of an investigation lasting several months .

Craig Murray, former British ambassador to Uzbekistan, has gained notoriety as one of the few diplomats to ignore the wishes of his government and openly criticize the country in which he was stationed.
"I was told before I went that the human rights situation [in Uzbekistan] hadn't changed much since the days of the Soviet Union, whereas in fact it had got much worse," he says.
In the first incident he was introduced to a man who told him that his grandchildren had been tortured in front of him in a bid to coerce him into signing a witness statement that would implicate two of his nephews as members of al-Qaida -- falsely, Murray claims.
In a report titled "Nowhere to turn: torture and ill-treatment in Uzbekistan", published last month, Human Rights Watch concluded that torture is "endemic to the criminal justice system" in Uzbekistan.
The nature of these cases so disturbed Murray that in October 2002 he made a speech to fellow diplomats and Uzbekistani officials at a human rights conference in Tashkent in which he criticized the regime and highlighted the "prevalence of torture in Uzbekistani prisons."
Later, while on holiday in Canada he was again summoned to London where he was served with 18 disciplinary charges, including accusations of "hiring dolly birds" to work in the visa department, having sex in his office with local girls in exchange for visas and drinking on the job.

He continues to speak out; he recently published a book about his experiences, "Murder in Samarkand -- A British Ambassador's Controversial Defiance of Tyranny in the War on Terror," which is scheduled to be made into a film by the director Michael Winterbottom, and he continues to write and give talks on the subject.
The nature of these cases so disturbed Murray that in October 2002 he made a speech to fellow diplomats and Uzbekistani officials at a human rights conference in Tashkent in which he criticized the regime and highlighted the "prevalence of torture in Uzbekistani prisons."
There is an argument that diplomats are part of a more far-reaching international governmental strategy where their job is to keep the lines of communication open with despotic regimes and that the role of blowing the whistle on human rights abuses is already fulfilled by NGOs and journalists.
The US ceased its effective alliance with Uzbekistan in 2005, nominally due to a massacre in May in Andijan where several hundred civilians were shot dead at a protest, but in reality, claims Murray, because Karimov had switched allegiances and formed a military partnership with Russia.

Manchester United face Preston North End in FA Cup on Monday
-----------------------
First Model with 2 correct:
Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has admitted that Wayne Rooney might be his best striker but insists the Old Trafford captain has to continue playing where it suits the team .
Van Gaal &apos;s decision to play Rooney in midfield for the majority of this season has come under scrutiny with United accused of playing dull football despite a run of just one defeat in 18 matches .
England manager Roy Hodgson has confirmed Rooney – who is closing on the all-time goalscoring records for Manchester United and England - will operate as a striker at international level , saying : &apos; He &apos;s a goalscorer , isn &apos;t he ? &apos;
-----------------------
Second Model with 0 correct:
Juan Mata (£38million), Ander Herrera (£28million) and Marouane Fellaini (£27million) are considered inferior midfield players to Rooney and the United boss clearly doesn't see Angel di Maria (£60million) or Ashley Young (£18million) as the answer in central midfield.
Though youngster James Wilson is pushing for a start, there may be another chance given to Colombian striker Falcao whose four goals this season have been a poor return given the hype when he signed on deadline day in the summer.
Despite United being in a top-four position having finished seventh last season under David Moyes, van Gaal has faced plenty of criticism in the past week with West Ham manager Sam Allardyce saying the team played long-ball football last weekend, and ex-United great Paul Scholes saying the players looked miserable.
The Dutch manager, who is used to working in high-pressure arenas like Barcelona and Bayern Munich, is coming out fighting, and not even United's best player this season goalkeeper David de Gea is exempt.

As the jigsaw puzzle of his complex and disturbed personality was reconstructed by investigators, the agony of his murder-suicide mission struck at the heart of his home town of Montabaur, for ever changed because of the actions of a Jekyll and Hyde figure whose warped personality made him lead two lives.
Fighting back tears in Digne, close to where his son perished on Tuesday, Mr Bramley said: ‘What is relevant is that it should never happen again; my son and everyone on that plane should not be forgotten, ever.
Lubitz masked his true condition – described by police as ‘severe burnout syndrome’ – from his employers and was aided by German confidentiality laws which forbade his doctors from revealing just how mentally ill he really was.
They particularly want to know if his blurred vision was a contributing factor to his catastrophic psychological collapse which led him to pilot his A320 Airbus into a French mountainside, killing himself and 149 innocent passengers and crew.

A notorious fugitive who's been evading authorities since 1998, when he faked his own death just before his trial on child sex-abuse charges, has been captured in Montana.
Daniel Clement Chafe, 55, was taken into custody Wednesday in Bozeman where he had been living under a different name, Lieutenant Gregg Hastings said.

Married Dr Peter Rubin, 53, bought gifts for the woman in her 40s, bombarded her with personal texts and made inappropriate comments in a ‘long campaign to woo her’, a tribunal heard.
The pair had sex at the Woodlands Medical Centre, in Didcot, Oxfordshire on Christmas Eve 2007 before Dr Rubin prescribed the morning after pill and said: ‘You had better take this or it will be just my luck you will be standing in an antenatal clinic’.
The affair cooled off in 2008, but the woman, known only as Patient A, reported the shamed family doctor to the General Medical Council when he tried to ‘forcibly remove her trousers’ during a consultation four years later.
She received a ‘strange’ package, which her partner, the father of her daughter, opened, containing an un-signed birthday card, mobile phone and SIM card, which the doctor later admitted sending after getting her details from medical records.
‘The panel considered that in the context of having just made such an inappropriate remark about her boyfriend to a young woman asking for contraceptive advice and then inviting her to kiss you, your conduct was sexually motivated.’

Danny Cipriani kicked five out of five to help Sale Sharks to a comfortable victory over Gloucester
After enjoying the sun, David Humphreys' side caught a cold and yet another defeat in this fixture has left Gloucester stuck in ninth place in the Aviva Premiership table.
James Hook struck two penalties for the visitors but Sale snatched a try in the 22nd minute when Samoa centre Johnny Leota managed to ground the ball against the base of a post after Andrei Ostrikov had been held up short.
The wing burst into the 22 and was tackled but from the ruck Cipriani's clever delayed pass sent lock Josh Beaumont over the line from close range.

"Let's not get carried away by the drums of war, because the United States, I am sure that they are exaggerating and distorting things to justify an invasion," Chavez said Monday, according to Venezuelan state media.
Speaking in Caracas Monday, Chavez proposed sending an international committee to Libya to mediate and help develop a peaceful solution to unrest in the North African country.
"Instead of sending marines and tanks and planes, why don't we send a goodwill commission to try to help so that they do not continue killing in Libya?
Chavez and Gadhafi have a close relationship, having bonded partly over shared opposition to U.S.
But there is no doubt that, regarding Libya, a campaign of lies is being woven -- the same that has been woven about Venezuela for a long time," he said.

'Our teams have dedicated themselves to ensuring that the Space Launch System (SLS) – the largest ever - will be built safely, affordably and on time,' said Virginia Barnes, Boeing SLS vice president and program manager.
Currently under construction, NASA’s Space Launch System will be the world’s most powerful launch vehicle.
From there, SLS will be evolved to a configuration that will be able to carry 130 metric tons (143 tons), more weight than any rocket ever has been able to carry.
'While many people think of the Space Launch System in terms of human exploration, SLS could have a wide application in a lot of other areas, including space science,” said Steve Creech, assistant program manager for strategy and partnerships for SLS.
Towering a staggering 384 feet tall, it will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds.
It will be able to carry payloads weighing 286,000 pounds to orbit.
'The Space Launch System could be really game-changing for space science,” said ACO manager Reggie Alexander.

This milestone marks NASA’s first CDR on a deep-space human exploration launch vehicle since 1961, when the Saturn V rocket underwent a similar design review as the United States sought to land an astronaut on the moon.
The smaller, 70-metric-ton SLS will stand 321 feet tall, provide 8.4 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, weigh 5.5 million pounds and carry 154,000 pounds of payload.
'For missions to the outer planets, for example, SLS could make it possible to do things that are currently impossible, such as sending larger scientific spacecraft with more instruments to far off destinations with reduced transit times.'
Agency scientific and engineering teams have been evaluating whether there would be potential benefits from launching deep space robotic spacecraft, such as the Europa Clipper, a proposed mission to one of Jupiter's icy moons, on the SLS rocket, and determined the rocket would enable the spacecraft to fly direct trajectories to our solar system’s outer planets, rather than using planetary gravities to gain speed, reducing transit time compared to current launch vehicles.

His questions again sought to undermine Pistorius' reliability and credibility and to portray the Olympic athlete as someone who was inventing his version of events and "tailoring" evidence to suit his story.
Nel asked whether he had waited for a response, as he said would have been reasonable, pointing out that his ex-girlfriend Samantha Taylor had testified he had done that on a previous occasion when he'd heard a noise.
The runner has admitted to the killing but said he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder in the bathroom when he fired through the toilet door and killed her.
After Judge Thokozile Masipa pressed Pistorius on the question, the athlete said he wasn't making mistakes because he was tired -- prompting Nel to ask why, in that case, he was making mistakes.

Located some 30 kilometers from Freetown, this tiny strip of land in the Sierra Leone river served as a major post for the transatlantic slave trade in the 18th century.

Its crumbling ruins, blanketed by overgrown weeds and ivy roots, remain relatively untouched to this day, serving as a reminder of the island's dark past.

New York (CNN) -- The mother of two would often drive back and forth between her suburban Scarsdale, New York, home and the bleak-looking, one-story brick warehouse in Queens.
She probably thought about her girls, 3 and 13.
She faces federal narcotics charges.
Federal authorities say Andrea Sanderlin, 45, ran the marijuana operation from the warehouse, where they found two rooms packed with more than 1,000 marijuana plants and large amounts of dried marijuana, along with state-of-the-art lighting, irrigation, and ventilation systems to facilitate the hydroponic growing of the plants, according to court documents.
"The warehouse was filled with over $3 million worth of hydroponic marijuana and the organization covertly produced 3,000 marijuana plants," Brian Crowell, special agent in charge at the Drug Enforcement Administration, said in a statement Tuesday.
Sanderlin was arrested the same day, after agents followed her to the warehouse and entered on a warrant, court documents say.

Sanderlin had recently picked up the sport of horseback riding and took lessons with her teenage daughter at Twin Lakes Farm, a riding academy and competitive show stable in Bronxville, according to owner Scott Tarter.
The electricity company told them about an account connected to Sanderlin's telephone number in the name of "Fantastic Enterprises" in Queens, at a location that was using "an unusually high amount of electricity."
Tarter described Sanderlin as a "beginner adult rider" who came to the academy in January after buying a Friesian horse for recreational riding.

However, sources close to Google have claimed the app, which is expected to be free, has recently been submitted to Apple for approval.

The FA said Whelan had breached FA Rule E3[1] in that comments made to the media were abusive and/or insulting and/or constituted improper conduct and/or brought the game into disrepute, and was an 'aggravated breach' as it included 'a reference to ethnic origin and/or race and/or nationality and/or religion or belief'.
Whelan had previously indicated he would resign if the FA even suggested he was guilty of using racist language saying in November: 'Should they even suggest I'm guilty, I would immediately resign from my position as chairman of Wigan Athletic.'

That pronouncement landed as Mr Palmer's Waratah Coal and Metallurgical Corporation of China were granted major project status by the Commonwealth for the 'China First', a $7.5 billion thermal coal mine in Queensland.
And today, in a statement, he has tried to close off the controversy by saying the comments he made were meant for 'one Chinese state-owned company that has failed to honour its agreements and announcements made to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in early 2006'.
Clive Palmer the mining magnate seeking to shore up a long-term business connection with the biggest market in Asia and the Chinese happy to tap into his hold on Australia's natural resources.
Long before he labelled the Chinese 'mongrels and bastards', he was regaling the Federal Government about the benefits of working with China and, in fact accused Australian politicians, including then PM Kevin Rudd, of not treating them with dignity.
CITIC insists that account was to be used only for covering the operational costs of Port Preston, an iron ore port in Western Australia.
'Why should the average American, regardless of his education or qualifications, have the right to invest $950 million in Australia but the ­average Chinese, regardless of how much money he has, is not allowed to invest without our Treasurer saying so?'

The Obama administration quietly announced on Tuesday that it intends to change the way Americans learn about natural disasters and other major emergencies during radio and TV broadcasts, giving the president the ability to flip a switch and address the entire nation at once.
The Emergency Alert System, the latest version of a program first established in 1951, blasts out  emergency messages in the event of local weather emergencies, but can also be used to warn Americans about terror attacks and major natural disasters.
But now the Federal Communications Commission has filed public notice of a rule change that would bypass the daisy-chain entirely and give the federal government instant access to all the nation's airwaves at once, in the event of a national emergency.

That source for African-Americans was the God of the Bible, who had sent Moses to lead the slaves out of slavery and who had sent his son to preach "good news to the poor and set the captives free."
But that cultural background within Christianity translated into an ecclesiology that not only nurtured the development of the black churches, but also conferred upon black clergy a status that has been akin to royalty.
In a segregated society, church was the place where people fulfilled their human potential, developed their God-given talents, made corporate decisions, voted for their officers, owned property, created benevolent societies, raised money for schools and scholarships, celebrated their marriages, blessed their babies, mourned their loved ones' deaths and even learned how to read.
What is irrefutable is that without a deep and authentic faith and a passion for the institutional development of that faith, African-Americans could have never sustained the fortitude necessary to survive and succeed in the American experience.

The mobile office comes complete with a desk that can double as a meeting table.
Food trucks, laundry, mobile dentistry, and other ad hoc services can pop up around a 'Work On Wheels' site, ready to serve people working there, the firm believes.

Andy Slaughter, Labour MP for Hammersmith, accused the Prime Minister and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt of dishonestly claiming Charing Cross would keep its A&E when they knew of plans to downgrade it.

The great tits, or Parus major, in Wytham woods have been studied by researchers at University of Oxford since the 1940s and most carry unique identifying chips that allow scientists to keep track of them.
The researchers watched how great tits in Wytham Wood, in Oxford, learned how to solve a puzzle box, contained within a cage (left), that had a blue and red door that could be opened to the left or right (right)
The puzzle boxes were scattered around Wytham Wood in Oxford among populations of birds that learned to open the door of the box to the left (blue dot), to the right (red dot) or where they learned no preference (green)

Abstractive Summary:
Discovery is the first example of cultural conformity in non-primate animals
Adapting to local traditions was a key factor in evolution of human culture
University of Oxford scientists made the discovery while studying how great tits learned to raid milk bottles and how it spread around Britain
Ten great tits from Wytham Wood in Oxford were taught to open puzzle boxes to get food and within weeks it had spread to hundreds of birds
Researchers say their findings challenge conventional beliefs about the development of culture in birds and other non-primate animals

For householders who still get their milk delivered in glass bottles , waking up to find the foil lids have been pecked open may seem little more than a rather annoying piece of avian thievery .
And now scientists studying how this behaviour first emerged and spread among populations of great tits during the 20th century have made an even more startling discovery - the birds not only pass on cultural traditions , but will change them to conform to those practiced in the local area .

Dr Lucy Aplin, first author of the report, added: 'Even when a great tit already has experience of using one method, if it moves to a new area which favours the alternative solution this bird is likely to adopt the method preferred by its new group.
The great tits, or Parus major, in Wytham woods have been studied by researchers at University of Oxford since the 1940s and most carry unique identifying chips that allow scientists to keep track of them.
The findings may help to explain why great tits capable of raiding milk bottles by pecking through the foil tops spread so quickly around Britain, and persisted for so long.

Washington (CNN) -- Police erred by not obtaining an extended search warrant before attaching a tracking device to a drug suspect's car, the Supreme Court said in a unanimous ruling Monday.
A majority of justices said that secretly placing the device and monitoring the man's movements for several weeks constituted a government "search," and therefore, the man's constitutional rights were violated.
Four other justices also concluded that the search was improper but said it was because the monthlong monitoring violated the suspect's expectation of privacy.
"We have no doubt that such a physical intrusion would have been considered a 'search' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when it was adopted."
But a group of four justices led by Samuel Alito concluded that the majority's reasoning was "artificial" and did not address larger legal concerns of searches in the digital age, including GPS.
He said that in this case, four weeks of tracking was more than enough to justify police getting a search warrant.

Abstractive Summary:
Following a car for weeks via a tracking device requires a search warrant, justices say

Antonin Scalia wrote for a five-vote majority that a person's property is legally sacred, and the government had to justify placing a GPS device on the vehicle.
Unlike in the Jones case, a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that this was not a "search," so no warrant was required to place the device on Pineda-Moreno's Jeep Cherokee.
Growing sophistication of electronic devices to monitor the movements of suspects made this issue ripe for review, since lower courts had disagreed on when such surveillance is permissible without a warrant.
But a group of four justices led by Samuel Alito concluded that the majority's reasoning was "artificial" and did not address larger legal concerns of searches in the digital age, including GPS.

The files also reveal each phone will have a central 'spine' and an endoskeleton - nicknamed 'endo' - made of ribs that the individual modules will clip on to.
There will be three different sized endos - including mini, medium and large - to rival the existing range of phones currently on the market, from compacts to phablets.
According to the developer kit, Ara phones will be able run on multiple batteries - when one battery dies, it can be detached and replaced with a full battery module.
'The Ara platform consists of an on-device packet-switched data network based on the MIPI UniPro protocol stack, a flexible power bus, and an elegant industrial design that mechanically unites the modules with an endoskeleton.'
In theory, any sensor that can be fitted to a module will be able to attach to an Ara device, and while Google will make the shell, these modules will be made by other companies.

(CNN)Chile's Calbuco Volcano erupted again Thursday, marking the third time since last week, the National Service of Geology and Mining said.
"There is still smoke on and off, but nothing so dramatic (as before)," said Billikopf, a retired university adviser on agricultural issues.
The explosion produced an extensive plume, but it was also described as smaller than the eruptions on April 22 and April 23, according to CNN Chile.
Deputy Interior Minister Mahmud Aleuy said about 1,500 people were evacuated, and security measures will continue as "contingency plans are operating," CNN Chile reported Thursday.

Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iran will not send a ship carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza as it had planned to do on Thursday, according to a report from the official news agency of Iran.
The Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Hossein Sheikholeslam, secretary-general of the International Conference for the Support of the Palestinian Intifada, as saying: "The Iranian ship carrying humanitarian aid will not go to Gaza."
IRNA said that Sheikholeslam told reporters in the northern city of Rasht that the ship had originally been scheduled to depart for Gaza on Thursday, but that its departure was postponed until Sunday because of restrictions imposed by Israel.
In a posting on the Israel Defense Forces website, the chief of the general staff said Israel has "a natural right to inspect and to prevent the flow of weapons into the Gaza Strip."
Israel's announcement came three weeks after ships in Israel's naval blockade sparred on May 31 with a flotilla of aid ships heading to Gaza.

Liturgusa algorei, a new species of praying mantis named after former US Vice-President Al Gore, was captured in a dense rain forest along the Amazon River in northern Peru, but other specimens were identified among museum collections collected over a century ago
Also unlike some other mantis species, they are not believed to engage in cannibalism.They are highly camouflaged and evade predators by running to the opposite side of their tree - a tactic also adopted by many tree-dwelling lizards.

Voight wrote in an opinion column published by the Hollywood Reporter on Sunday that Bardem and Cruz "should hang your heads in shame" and "ask forgiveness from the suffering people in Israel."

A chance conversation with a friend, who is a teacher at an international school here, revealed the scramble to organize alternative tests in other countries for young students hoping to get into elite U.S.
The decision was taken after a widespread cheating scandal was uncovered -- a number of scams were being employed to give some unscrupulous students and their parents advance warning about the questions to be included in the test.
According to education insiders in South Korea, cheating has been going on for years with cramming schools known as "Hakwons" mostly to blame.
The problem is there are hundreds of unregistered and unregulated cramming schools and tutors in the capital alone, who may be willing to cut corners to improve their results and earn themselves more customers.
The College Board, which runs the SAT system, has issued a statement explaining why it canceled the May SAT test in South Korea.
Principal Peter Daly is also worried, but says he's not surprised that Korea's hyper competitive school system has produced a cheating scandal.

At South Korea's most expensive boarding school, North London Collegiate School (NLCS) on Jeju Island, pupils are scrambling to make alternative arrangements to sit the SAT in other countries like Japan or Hong Kong.

Fraud and false claims for the state benefit that is most often abused has amounted to an astonishing £12.6 billion since the turn of the Millennium, MPs reported yesterday.
The amount sucked out of Housing Benefit by welfare cheats, in exaggerated claims, and through straightforward bureaucratic blunders was the equivalent of around £1 billion a year for the first 13 years of the century.
The loss to the taxpayer would pay the price of policing Britain for a year or cover more than four fifths of the bill for the road improvements that David Cameron has promised over the next five years.
And the influential Public Accounts Committee, which acts as a public spending watchdog, revealed the amount of fraud and error in Housing Benefit is still going up.
A report condemned the Department of Work and Pensions – which pays out for the benefit designed to cover the rent for people who cannot afford to pay their own – for failure to curb false claims, and added that MPs were sceptical of promises by civil servants to slash the losses by more than two thirds by this spring.

Mrs Hodge said: ‘Given the lack of evidence that the Department is getting to grips with fraud and error, we view with scepticism the Department’s confidence that it will meet its target.’
She said the Department was expecting ‘significant’ benefits from a siwth to ‘real-time information’, under which Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs will tell the DWP as soon as someone gets a job, rather than giving DWP officials updates on the earnings of claimants just once a year.
A report condemned the Department of Work and Pensions – which pays out for the benefit designed to cover the rent for people who cannot afford to pay their own – for failure to curb false claims, and added that MPs were sceptical of promises by civil servants to slash the losses by more than two thirds by this spring.
Around £12.6 billion has been spent on Housing Benefit overpayments since 2000, money that could have been used to improve the system.
Curbing fraud and error in Housing Benefit has proved difficult for all governments over the past 20 years, partly because the benefit is handed out by local councils which have varying levels of efficiency in detecting dishonest or inflated claims.

MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Barack Obama sometimes gets ribbed for his outsized ideas, like the massive stage built in Denver, Colorado, to accept the Democratic presidential nomination.
The artist plans to create a gigantic face of Obama sculpted from gravel and sand, which will cover nearly 2.5 acres (1 hectare) of Barcelona beachfront before the U.S.
"Obama's personality -- his youth, personal history and message of a new politics -- has fused with the historical moment to create someone larger than life," says the artist's dossier about the work, titled "Expectation."
He will use 500 tons of material -- mainly gravel but also sand and possibly some soil in black, brown and white tones -- to create the image on a flat piece of land slightly raised and overlooking the Mediterranean, near downtown Barcelona.

Then, the artist's technical team will direct volunteers with garden rakes to put the final touches on the materials, making sure the various colors are spread properly on the ground in order to depict Obama's eyes, hair, cheeks and collar, according to the plans.
Rodriguez-Gerada said he'll need to raise about $18,700 (15,000 euros) for other costs, such as rakes and gloves for volunteers, documentation, even portable toilets for the crew.

He issued the warning after initial investigations into the death of British Airways pilot Richard Westgate in 2012.
Sheriff Stanhope Payne, the senior coroner for Dorset who is currently investigating BA pilot Richard Westgate's death, has warned that those who are regularly exposed to plane fumes face 'consequential damage to their health'.
Mr Payne has written to British Airways boss Keith Williams and Andrew Haines, head of the Civil Aviation Authority, saying: ‘In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation has the power to take such action.’
He said he is concerned cabin occupants are being exposed to organophosphates, causing ‘damage to their health’.
If Sheriff Stanhope Payne, the senior coroner for Dorset, rules in the inquest into the death of British Airways co-pilot Richard Westgate that cabin air was partly to blame for his death, then it will be the first time an independent judge in the UK has put this on record.
A Civil Aviation Authority spokesman said government-funded research had found that ‘any link to ill health is unlikely’ but said it would look at the coroner’s report.

In partnership with the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC), CPL Aromas, the British-based international fragrance house that created the scent to an RSC brief, took inspiration from the scents and natural products in commonwealth countries, such as Jamaica, Canada and India.

Ahead of this weekend's Premier League action, Sportsmail will be providing you with all you need to know about every fixture, with team news, provisional squads, betting odds and Opta stats.
Here is all the information you need for Swansea City's home clash with Newcastle...
Swansea City vs Newcastle United (Liberty Stadium)
Angel Rangel of Swansea City receives the red card from referee Chris Foy against Sunderland
Managers: Garry Monk (Swansea), Alan Pardew (Newcastle)
Head-to-head league record: Swansea wins 12, draws 4, Newcastle wins 18
Jazz Richards could make his first Barclays Premier League start for nearly three years with Swansea having problems at right-back for the visit of Newcastle on Saturday.
Angel Rangel serves a one-match suspension after his red card at Sunderland last weekend and Dutch understudy Dwight Tiendalli is nursing a groin injury which has sidelined him since the end of August, so Richards stands by for his first top-flight start since Swansea's 1-1 draw with Tottenham in December 2011.
Wilfried Bony should return to lead the line with Bafetimbi Gomis dropping out from the goalless draw at Sunderland, but Jordi Amat (ankle) and Leon Britton (knee) are still absent.
Newcastle boss Alan Pardew will assess striker Papiss Cisse's match fitness ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to Swansea.
The Senegal international has been used as a substitute in each of the club's last two league games following his return from a fractured kneecap, but with goals at a premium, his manager would dearly love to have him at his disposal from the start.
Pardew otherwise has no fresh injury problems and while Ryan Taylor (cruciate ligament) played in a behind-closed-doors friendly in midweek, he, fellow defender Davide Santon (knee) and midfielders Siem de Jong (thigh) and Rolando Aarons (hamstring) remain on the comeback trail.

Swansea City have had the fewest touches in the opposition box (62) in the Premier League this season.
Newcastle have used as many French players in the Premier League this season as French Ligue 1 sides Paris Saint Germain and Toulouse have so far in 2014-15 (6).
Alan Pardew has a better win percentage as Newcastle manager in the Premier League (36%) than any other last five Magpies’ managers in the competition.
Of the 17 ever-present Premier League sides in 2014, Newcastle have won the fewest points (19), scored the fewest goals (19) and conceded the most (47).
Despite leaving in January, the only player to have scored more Premier League goals for Newcastle than Yohan Cabaye (7) since the start of last season is the now-departed Loic Remy (14).
Swansea have 11 players that have appeared in every Premier League game so far this season; more than any other side.
Alan Pardew has gone seven games without a win in the Premier League (L4 D3), his worst run of results in the competition at Newcastle United.

Fouad Massoum, 76, one of the founders of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan party led by Iraq's previous President Jalal Talabani, accepted the mostly ceremonial position after winning two-thirds of the votes in parliament.
The Kurds have spent weeks battling militants in Jalawla, 115 km (70 miles) northeast of Baghdad, and took complete control of the town today after overnight clashes.
Much of Iraq's recent bloodshed is linked to sectarian divisions that have deepened since Sunni militants  seized large swathes of northern Iraq last month and declared an Islamic empire.
In June, Kurdish forces took control of the northern oil city of Kirkuk after government troops abandoned their posts in the face of the Sunni Islamist rebel march towards Baghdad.

‘The higher-than-expected child death rates in the UK are a reminder to all of us that, even as we are seeing child mortality decline worldwide, countries need to examine what they are doing to make sure more children grow into adulthood.’
Judged alongside countries outside Europe, Britain had a higher childhood death rate than Australia, Israel, Japan, Singapore and South Korea.
Across Europe as a whole, death rates for under-fives were substantially worse in central and eastern regions than in the west.

And in many ways, Africa's growth patterns mirror those of the new China's.
Africa has presently 3% but with 15% of the world's population, 60% of world's uncultivated arable land and a fast-growing proportion of the world's discovered valuable natural resources, Africa's potential for growth over the next 10 years is greater than China's over the same period.
Charles Robertson, Global Chief Economist of Renaissance Capital, estimates that Africa's GDP will increase from $2 trillion to $29 trillion in today's money by 2050.
Last week, I returned with my Made In Africa Foundation, this time to the African Development Bank (AfDB) during its annual general meeting, in its 50th Anniversary year, to ensure that as this growth happens it benefits not just everyone else in the developed and the BRIC economies but Africans as well and in a fundamental and equitable way.
That's why I invited John Legend, Mos Def and Isaiah Washington, Youssou N'Dour and Akon to come along too, to advocate for the AfDB's audacious $68 billion PIDA plan to transform the continent in building railways, roads, clean water supplies and those things we take for granted -- the basic infrastructure of communication and trade to enable worthwhile lives for all our people.

The FBI is investigating after a police officer used a stun gun to subdue Bryce Masters in suburban Kansas City, Missouri, on Sunday afternoon after stopping a car he was driving because it had a warrant attached to it.
'He was like 'what am I being arrested for?' The cop just grabbed him and said 'you're under arrest,' said Martes.

Data from the new Atacama Large Millimeter Array, a growing array of radio telescopes in the high desert of Chile, have mapped a "superwind" flowing out of a nearby galaxy.
Well, for the first time, the new ALMA analysis shows enough mass in this wind to carry away a large fraction of the gas in the galaxy.
This suggests an answer to a longstanding mystery about why galaxies today do not have more stars.
The new ALMA data show clearly that the gas from which those stars would form is being blown out of the galaxy.
When a superwind disrupts the gas clouds that might have formed more stars, we call it "feedback," because if the star formation rate is very high, the superwind is strong, so a lot of gas is heated and/or ejected from the galaxy, so fewer stars form, and the superwind dies down.

Fiona Taylor, 44, bought fake bags from China and sold them as the real thing, making a huge profit
A woman who made more than £400,000 selling fake designer handbags spent the money on school fees for her children and luxury goods for herself.
Fiona Taylor, 44, of Newton on Ouse, North Yorkshire, organised 'handbag parties' where she sold counterfeit bags for hundreds of pounds each, telling buyers they were the real thing.
Teesside Crown Court was told that Taylor sold fake Mulberry bags at the parties which she organised across North Yorkshire, telling one woman they were sourced through a contact at Mulberry's own factory.
So many of Taylor's customers contacted the genuine Mulberry store in York that the firm contacted Trading Standards.
In June last year Taylor's home was searched and a large number of fake Mulberry, Gucci, Louis Vitton, Prada and Chanel bags and other items were seized.
Susanna Proctor, defending, said Taylor had been made redundant from her job in a bank and - without a source of income - began buying bags for friends.

Taylor admitted two counts of selling counterfeit goods, two counts of concealing criminal property and 14 counts of possessing criminal property.

Following a dispute between Domenech and striker Nicolas Anelka, the team refused to train and captain Patrice Evra was seen arguing with fitness coach Robert Duverne.

The mink scrambles out of the bucket and onto the concrete as if to reassess the situation, taking a running jump and diving back into the bucket for a second round with the fish.
It takes the furry beast three attempts to hoist the fish out of the bucket and onto dry land, where it lies flapping its tail helplessly.
The mink then drags the fish away and into a hole in some nearby rocks on a pier on Lake Ontario in Webster, New York.

Carl Cox driving an old banger, Norman Cook taking some time out in a fluffy towel and Danny Howard slipping into his PJs to catch the Coronation Street omnibus.
Cox, Cook and Howard are just three DJs who took time out of their hectic, jet-setting lives to share their more private passions with British photographer Jessica van der Weert for a charity exhibition raising awareness for the British Tinnitus Association (BTA) – an organisation that supports people with the debilitating hearing condition that affects almost 10% of UK adults and which affects many DJs.
Pop culture photographer van der Weert has spent two years snapping her favourite music men and women, including Annie Mac, Zane Lowe, Paul Oakenfold and Mary Ann Hobbs, for the exhibition which is set to show in Berlin, New York and Ibiza this summer after a standout London debut (complete, of course, with an epic after party).
Norman Cook - aka Fatboy Slim - is one of the DJs to be photographed by Jess van der Weert for charity exhibition Flipside
FlipSide, in association with art agents Beautiful Crime and Eddie Lock, combines van der Weert's two loves, music and photography, and is particularly a celebration of the dance music industry, bringing some of the world’s biggest techno, trance and house music DJs and producers out from behind the decks to reveal a rather more private side.
The photography exhibition - also featuring Boy George - aims to raise awareness for the British Tinnitus Association (BTA)
Norman Cook - aka Fat Boy Slim - is a huge supporter of the project, and was pictured by van der Weert in the changing room of his beloved Brighton FC.
As clubbers and DJs we are far more likely to be affected and so this worldwide exhibition aims to raise awareness of the condition, how to avoid it in the first place, and most importantly how to cope with it if you already have it.'

As for Can and Lazar Markovic, both are still unknown quantities but they are as much ‘for the future’ as they are first-team guarantees and all indications from pre-season are that both will grow to become superb players.
No signings have yet got fans salivating with excitement, but should Brendan follow through on some of the reported interest in the likes of Karim Benzema, Isco or Marco Reus, then this could go down as Liverpool’s most fruitful summer in over a decade.
Unlike the situation Spurs faced last year though, Liverpool already had many of these targets in their sights, while not a single player signed so far has been acquired using the money made from Suarez.
Not only this, but Lambert is a low-risk signing given his experience and small fee, whilst Lallana – who may miss the first couple of fixtures with a knee injury - was in the Premier League team of the year, so you can’t really ask for more of an indication of a ‘good buy’.
And while Dejan Lovren only has one season of Premier League experience, he adapted very well to its rigours, and played in the Champions League for previous clubs Lyon and Dinamo Zagreb.

A vitriolic letter written by the future King Edward VIII in which he branded the French Canadians 'rotten' and 'the completest passengers' during a tour of the country has emerged 96 years later.
In the letter written a few months after World War One to his mistress Freda Dudley Ward, the 25-year-old Edward expresses his disgust at their reluctance to support the British Empire.
Contempt: The future King Edward VIII scoffed at the French Canadians during his royal tour (pictured here)
The First World War divided Canada, with the French-speaking population accused of not doing enough to fight against the Germans.
Disgust: Edward said the French Canadians 'really aren't worth all the trouble' as they are 'shirkers, particularly war as they all voted against conscription' - he is pictured here in Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1919
The six-page letter was written by the future King to married mother-of-two Mrs Dudley Ward, years before he gave up the throne in order to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson.
Edward abdicated in 1936 (pictured addressing the nation) so he could marry American Wallis Simpson

Just 47 minutes after restaurant staff called police, officers tracked down the teenager to a nearby flat where they found two balaclavas, 2,000 SEK (£187) and the girl's mobile phone.
It was in March this year that two young girls in balaclavas armed with an 11in kitchen knife ran in to a Max Hamburgers restaurant in Halmstad.

The double-crested cormorants, which are protected but not endangered, have lived on a decrepit section of the bridge for decades.
Despite the eastern section of the bridge being replaced with a new $6.4m span, the birds have refused to relocate, meaning officials have been unable to dismantle the old section which was damaged in the Loma Prieta earthquake.
Taxpayers are footing a $33 million bill to help relocate 800 double-crested comorants who have lived under a now replaced section of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge for decades
Officials have unsuccessfully used pricey decoys, bird recordings and have placed specially-made nests planted on the new bridge, to lure the birds some 100 feet.
The eastern section of the bridge, damaged 25 years ago during the Loma Prieta earthquake, was replaced at a cost of $6.4 million, and officials now want to dismantle it
California Department of Transportation spokesperson Leah Robinson Leach said the agency was required to follow the law and if they didn't do so, the penalties they could face 'could far exceed' the bird relocation costs.

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN) -- When Susana Trimarco's daughter Marita Veron was 23, she vanished from their hometown in Argentina, a suspected victim of a human trafficking and prostitution ring with links throughout Latin America and Europe.
While chasing down leads on Marita's whereabouts, she's entered dark and dangerous brothels and confronted pimps and politicians who, she says, are complicit in her daughter's disappearance.
My life will be completely absorbed with this fight until she is back and safe," Trimarco said.
The investigation that has followed has led police and Trimarco to believe that she was kidnapped and forced into prostitution, either in rural Argentina or Spain.

American killed in shark attack off Western Australia
Over the past 50 years, only one person has been killed by a shark each year in Australia on average, compared to the 87 people who drown at Australian beaches on average each year, according to Surf Life Saving Australia (SLSA).
Therefore, the hysteria in the media surrounding a shark attack seems disproportional to other fatal incidents.
The frequency of attacks also reflects the popularity of water-based activities in harbors, estuarine areas and rivers, with people more likely to encounter species such as bull sharks, which have a propensity to inhabit shallow nearshore coastal areas, bays, harbors and rivers in summer months.

Kristalina Georgieva, vice president of the European Commission, said: ‘The adjustments for the UK means that UK has to pay more, but also that as a result of this increase, the UK rebate will go up.’ Asked if the rebate had been in doubt, the EC vice-president said: ‘No, absolutely not.’

David Cameron angrily insisted the UK would pay nothing by the December deadline and called yesterday’s emergency meeting of finance ministers in Brussels for the overall sum to be renegotiated.

At an afternoon news conference in New York, Schumer said TSA agents would be distracted by having to measure knives and other items like baseball bats.
"These items are dangerous, and have not become less so in the years since they were banned from planes," the New York Democrat said.
"Now is not the time for reduced vigilance, or to place additional burdens on TSA agents who should be looking for dangerous items."
"The attacks on September 11, 2001, demonstrated that in the confined environment of an airplane, even a small blade in the hands of a terrorist can lead to disaster," wrote Markey, who is running for the U.S.

At least nine people, six of them children, were killed and two dozen were wounded on Saturday in a suicide bomb attack targeting the Indian consulate in Afghanistan's Jalalabad city, near the border of Pakistan.
The blast was so powerful that pieces of bodies landed inside the consulate and window panes were shattered.
In October 2009, a Taliban suicide bomber attacked the Indian embassy in Kabul, killing at least 17 people.
In New Delhi, India's External Affairs Ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin confirmed that all Indian officials in the consulate were safe, and then hinted that the assault had been planned outside Afghanistan.
The attack occurred on a day when Mail Today reported that India had warned its ambassador to Kabul, Amar Sinha, of a plot by Pakistan-based bombers to assassinate him, and recommended that he not leave home without a bullet-proof jacket nor travel in a convoy of less than three armoured Land Cruisers.
Horrifying: Though there were no casualties within the consulate the attack marks a severe breach of security on Indian-owned territory
Top sources told Mail Today that the government is now going to send an elite contingent of 50 more ITBP commandoes to guard Indian missions in that country.

During tests, the researchers found that the bacterium produces hydrogen under saline and alkaline conditions in amounts that rival genetically modified organisms.
Hydrogen produced by living organisms is called biohydrogen and is a type of fuel, similar to bio-diesel or bio-gas.
Biofuels can be taken from food crops, known as ‘first generation biofuels’, waste, known as ‘second generation’, and microbes, referred to as ‘third’ or ‘advanced’ generation biofuels.
Extracting third-generation biofuels is beneficial because it doesn’t impact on food production, or costs, and is said to be around 10 times more efficient as capturing sunlight compared to 'second-generation' waste.

The grandson of famous soprano and radio star Queenie Ashton has revealed how his 79-year-old Australian father was humiliatingly tied to a hospital bed in Phuket, Thailand with bedsheets and left in pain for hours during a nightmare ordeal.
The unorthodox restraints were used on expat Anthony Lawson after he tried to seek help when his requests for a drink of water, an IV change and prescribed sleeping pills allegedly went unanswered for three hours.
The award-winning commercial film and video director, who once voiced a range of Cathay Pacific airline commercials amongst others and also lent his voice to Star TV in Hong Kong, later died from stage four colon cancer on January 8 while still reeling from the traumatic experience.

'Even right at the end, when he seemingly wasn’t consciously there, the one thing that was still always on his mind - and that’s what got at me the worst - he was still thinking about that night.'
The detailed complaint paints a traumatic picture of Mr Lawson's brief stay at Vachira after he was transferred from Mission Hospital on November 18, 2014, with a suspected pulmonary embolism following a hernia operation.

The grandson of famous soprano and radio star Queenie Ashton has revealed how his 79-year-old Australian father was humiliatingly tied to a hospital bed in Phuket, Thailand with bedsheets and left in pain for hours during a nightmare ordeal.
The unorthodox restraints were used on expat Anthony Lawson after he tried to seek help when his requests for a drink of water, an IV change and prescribed sleeping pills allegedly went unanswered for three hours.
Mr Lawson, who was born in Sydney in 1935, but lived in England and Hong Kong before retiring in Thailand in 1998, was allegedly neglected and mistreated after being admitted to Phuket's main government hospital.
The award-winning commercial film and video director, who once voiced a range of Cathay Pacific airline commercials amongst others and also lent his voice to Star TV in Hong Kong, later died from stage four colon cancer on January 8 while still reeling from the traumatic experience.
His mother Ethel, who went by the stage name Queenie Ashton, was well-known for her role as Granny Bishop in the Australian radio serial Blue Hills which aired from 1949-76.
Ashton then reportedly met Vachira Hospital’s Deputy Director Somnuek Jirayuth, International Department head nurse Ms Methavee and two other nurses on January 29 where any wrongdoing was denied.
The detailed complaint paints a traumatic picture of Mr Lawson's brief stay at Vachira after he was transferred from Mission Hospital on November 18, 2014, with a suspected pulmonary embolism following a hernia operation.
'I find the hospital's explanation and reasoning behind what happened to be flimsy at best,' Ashton told the Phuket Gazette, the local paper which first reported Mr.

England have scored 26 goals in four matches against San Marino and conceded just one, Davide Gualtieri's infamous strike just 8.3 seconds into a World Cup qualifier in Bologna in 1993.
'I am enjoying the role of captain and the responsibility and in terms of results it is going very well,' added Rooney, 'It's always nice to score goals but the most important thing is the performance and winning the game.'
Despite his domestic ban at present, Rooney is just three goals behind Jimmy Greaves in the England scoring charts and eight behind the country's all-time leader Sir Bobby Charlton.
With San Marino and Estonia to face in the next five days, it could be assumed that the Manchester United striker could take a large step towards surpassing those landmarks, and Rooney admits it is in the back of his mind.

Cosmetic surgery cowboys will have ‘nowhere to hide’ when new rules to protect patients come into force, a Health Minister promised last night.
In a victory for The Mail on Sunday, Dan Poulter said ‘robust action’ would be taken against rogue operators to safeguard those who go under the knife or opt for other treatments such as Botox.
Plans to make the £3 billion-a-year industry safer will be put before Parliament in January.
It was years before anyone spotted that the implants ruptured far more frequently than other brands.
Sir Bruce put forward 40 recommendations to clean up the industry and Dr Poulter said the Government aims to put every one into action.
The Mail on Sunday has campaigned for improvements in five key areas, including minimum standards for cosmetic surgeons,  an end to ‘hard sell’, and full training and regulation of those administering Botox and dermal fillers.
Congratulating The Mail on Sunday for its ‘vigorous’ campaign, Dr Rajiv Grover, president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said the Government appeared to be acting on the first three areas, while it had not yet committed to the last two.
Concerns remain about key details, such as whether the breast implant register will be compulsory.
The review of rules was triggered after French company Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) was found to be using industrial grade silicone in its implants

Abstractive Summary:
New rules for plastic surgeons to be put forward in January
Doctors must hold UK insurance and keep log of patient outcomes
End to special offers, deals and glossy advertising for procedures
Rules won't force those who inject Botox to be medically trained
A register of breast operations to log the implants used and spot any problems with them.
Full training to ensure that cosmetic surgeons are safe.
Compulsory indemnity insurance to make sure that patients can sue  if things go wrong.
An end to irresponsible advertising and offers such as ‘feelgood divorce packages’.

Miss Little, 31, of Cuckfield in West Sussex, said a breast implant register was urgently needed, adding: ‘These changes won’t help me or others.’
Others remain worried Ministers will bow to industry pressure and stop short of meeting our fifth demand by ensuring all those administering Botox, fillers and laser therapy are properly trained and registered.
The plans are the Government’s official response to a Health Department review of the industry, which was led by NHS medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh.
The review was triggered by the PIP scandal, in which up to 47,000 women in Britain were fitted with the French implants made from industrial-grade silicone.

But his fingerprints are on the signing of Brazilian full-back Douglas who has started only one game; the signing two seasons ago of Alex Song with the promise that he could also play as a centre-back; and most recently missing out on Mallorca’s 18-year-old midfielder Marco Asensio, who he seemed to have sealed but who looks like ultimately being signed by rivals Real Madrid.
All that might be forgotten if Vermaelen returns with two outstanding semi-final performances in the Champions League but Barcelona supporters have long since stopped sharing their sporting director’s optimism.
This summer the club failed to land PSG’s young Brazilian Marquinhos and overlooked a host of La Liga based options such as Real Sociedad’s Iñigo Martinez, Villarreal’s Mateo Musacchio, Espanyol’s Hector Moreno or Athletic Bilbao’s Aymeric Laporte.

Jersey accountant Robert Brown, 58, who also wants to see the Queen Mother’s will,  is seeking to prove he is Margaret’s secret child and that she hid the pregnancy.
Yesterday Mr Brown was granted permission to seek judicial review of a refusal to allow him access under the Freedom of Information Act to documents he claims show there was a ‘secret judicial process’ for sealing royal wills.
Mr Justice Phillips said at London’s High Court the case gave rise ‘to important points of principle and practice’ regarding open justice and the public interest.
He claims the later stages of pregnancy were covered up using body doubles and that he was sent to Kenya to be brought up as the child of Cynthia and  Douglas Brown.

'We have a challenging three months ahead of us as we navigate closer to the comet, but after a 10'year journey it’s great to be able to say that our spacecraft is ready to conduct unique science at comet 67P/C-G,' says Fred Jansen, ESA’s Rosetta mission manager.
And, in a series of stunning new images, it reveals how comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko has begun to develop into an exciting ball of dust and gas.
In November of this year the Philae lander will be sent to touch down on the surface of the comet (artist's illustration shown), which will be the first landing ever performed on a comet.
'It’s beginning to look like a real comet,' says Holger Sierks, principal investigator for OSIRIS, the Optical, Spectroscopic and Infrared Remote Imaging System, at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, Germany.
Even though it is still more than 370 million miles (600 million kilometres) from the sun - more than four times the distance between Earth and sun - its surface has already started to warm, causing its ices to turn to gas and escape from its rock-ice nucleus.
The images shown here were taken during a six-week period that saw the orbiter’s 11 science experiments and the lander and its 10 instruments switched back on and checked out after more than 2.5 years of hibernation.

But 21 years and four adopted children later, the couple -- who were married in California in 2008 -- is fighting to stay together since Deloizy's final visa expired in September.

Himes chronicles their daily life on his blog, where he creates a "virtual scrapbook" of the couple's children: his daughter, Claire, getting her ears pierced for Christmas; his son, Jacob being rushed to the hospital when he bit his tongue after falling off his pogo stick; and the family trip to Washington for the White House Easter Egg Roll in 2010.

But a witness told CNN affiliate WKMG-TV that the whale approached the glass side of the 35-foot-deep tank at Shamu Stadium, jumped up and grabbed the trainer by the waist, shaking her so violently that her shoe came off.
Jaime Zalac said the organization had called on SeaWorld "to stop confining oceangoing mammals to an area that to them is like the size of a bathtub, and we have also been asking the park to stop forcing the animals to perform silly tricks over and over again.
Jeffrey Ventre, a former SeaWorld trainer, described Brancheau as "a great trainer" and Tillikum as "a great animal" who has sired 13 offspring.
The 11,000-pound, 22-foot-long whale was "not accustomed to people being in his tank" and "wouldn't have realized he was dealing with a very fragile human being," Solomons said at the time.

Asseri is fighting a years-long battle for asylum in the United States, convinced his life will be in danger if he is forced to return home.
The case presents a dilemma for the Obama administration as the President travels to Saudi Arabia to meet with King Abdullah amid a time of strained relations between the close allies.
Saudi Arabia's radical form of Islam mandates the death penalty for same-sex relations.
In a petition seeking asylum to the United States obtained by CNN, he wrote that "unfair bias" in the treatment of cases in Saudi Arabia made it "morally impossible for me to continue."

"I am deeply concerned by the violence and discrimination targeting LGBT persons around the world â€” whether it is passing laws that criminalize LGBT status, beating citizens simply for joining peaceful LGBT pride celebrations, or killing men, women, and children for their perceived sexual orientation," Obama said.
Asseri had been convinced that Obama's stated commitment to gay rights would trump politics and keep him safe in the United States.
The last Saudi diplomat to seek asylum was in 1994, when Mohammed al-Khilewi, then first secretary for the Saudi mission to the United Nations, was granted asylum for publicly criticizing his country's human rights record and alleged support for terrorism.
In the rejection letter, obtained by CNN, the government says "evidence indicates that you ordered, incited, assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution of others on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion."

He agreed and they create three embryos - but two months later he broke up with her and said he no longer wanted children
They had signed agreement saying both needed to consent to use embryos
But her cancer treatment left her infertile and she argued she has the right to biological children and 'it is too late for him to back out of his promises'
Dunston has since had a son with a donor but this will not affect the case

First Model with 3 correct:
A doctor who froze embryos with her boyfriend after she was diagnosed with cancer is now battling him in court after he broke up with her and said he no longer wants children .
Karla Dunston , 42 , maintains that she has the right to have her biological children and should control the future of the embryos , while her ex-boyfriend Jacob Szafranski , 32 , argues that he never agreed to give up his say in the matter .
In court : Karla Dunston and Jacob Szafranski created frozen embryos with their egg and sperm after she was diagnosed with cancer .
-----------------------
Second Model with 1 correct:
Knowing that the chemotherapy could leave her infertile, she asked Szafranski if he would provide his sperm so that she could freeze embryos for potential future use.
The battle now concerns whether the pact occurred when Szafranski gave the sample or when they signed the medical consent form requiring joint consent for the use of the embryos.
Karla Dunston, 42, maintains that she has the right to have her biological children and should control the future of the embryos, while her ex-boyfriend Jacob Szafranski, 32, argues that he never agreed to give up his say in the matter.
Dunston has since gone on to carry and give birth to a son - using a donor egg and donor sperm, Szafranski's attorney confirmed.
But he added that this does not affect the outcome of the case as the court distinguishes between a child that is biological and 'essentially adopted'.

London (CNN) -- Former News of the World journalist and royal editor Clive Goodman told a court in London Thursday that Princess Diana had leaked a royal phone book to him, UK media reported.

One so-called "Green Book," containing confidential phone numbers of royals and their staff, arrived at his office in an envelope with his name on it, Goodman said.

The cricket commentator, columnist and former staffer to Bob Carr, addressed the National Press Club on Wednesday as part of a women in media series.

LONDON, England (CNN) -- Heather Mills, the estranged wife of Paul McCartney, was granted nearly £25 million ($50 million) in her divorce proceedings with the former Beatle, she said Monday.
"I'm so glad it's over and it was an incredible result, in the end, to secure my and my daughter's future, and that of all the charities that I obviously plan on helping," said Mills, dressed in a khaki, green and blue suit with a bright red shirt.
She said the judge did not agree with her on important details, including how long the couple lived together or even McCartney's personal wealth, which she estimated at £800 million ($1.6 billion).
McCartney and Mills failed to agree on a settlement ending their four-year marriage in divorce hearings last month, leaving the judge to decide the terms.

Organisers are also required to transport 82,000 people dubbed members of the 'Olympic Family' from the hotels to the main event locations in Stratford, East London, in 25 minutes.
London transport chiefs have developed a computer programme called the ONE model that allows analysts to input travel itineraries into a traffic management system which then automatically changes lights to green as dignitaries pass along the route.
However, if there is congestion along the route, TfL's specialised SCOOT system – which was dramatically improved using £12million of public money – can alter traffic signals in the immediate and surrounding areas to further favour the VIP cars.
Major traffic restrictions will be enforced along the whole route between 6am and midnight during the 30 days of Olympic and Paralympic events.
Rings road: The BMW courtesy cars provided for VIPs will glide along thanks to the signs denoting lanes for Olympic officials only
Organisers are still deciding whether to enforce the restrictions during a 15-day break between the Olympic and Paralympics – August 12 to 29 – even though very few dignitaries will be in London.
Some roads, including Constitution Hill and Birdcage Walk, surrounding Buckingham Palace will be completely closed to the public – providing sole access to the VIP vehicles and further disrupting journeys for ordinary motorists who will be forced to take alternative routes.
John Biggs, London Assembly Member for City and East, said: 'On some parts of the ORN it will not only be pretty horrendous for travellers, but some pedestrian crossings and right-hand turns which will be abolished previously had fatalities on them, which is a great cause for concern.
Meanwhile, athletes will be allowed to travel along the Games Lanes, but only by bus or bicycle as they are excluded from using the luxury BMW saloon cars given to IOC chiefs and sponsors.
Competitors will make up just one-fifth of the total number of people accredited to use the Games Lanes, with most athletes expected to be staying on the Olympic Park.

Abstractive Summary:
82,000 members of the 'Olympic family' will travel in special lanes
Experts warn of chaos for ordinary road users in London
240 VIPs will be given exclusive use of their own luxury BMW saloon, complete with a driver, while another 2,800 officials will use a pool of opulent vehicles provided free.
Along the Olympic routes all non-Olympic traffic, including private cars, lorries, buses and taxis, will have to use the bus lane. The outside lane will be reserved for Olympic officials.
Transport chiefs will remove pedestrian crossings along the route to make way for the VIP lanes.
Right turns will be banned on junctions on the route to ensure traffic does not hold up the Olympic dignitaries.
Organisers have spent £12million of public money fitting underground sensors along the dignitaries' route which will detect congestion surrounding VIP cars and then doctor nearby traffic signals to speed them on their way.
The fleet of luxury cars will not be available to Olympic athletes who will have to use special buses and bicycles.
Motorists will be slapped with a £200 fine if they ignore the restrictions and venture into the Games Lanes – imposed between 6am and midnight on 30 miles of Central London roads.

It stipulates that 82,000 'Olympic Family' members – made up of athletes, officials and VIP guests – should be transported to event venues in times far faster than existing journey durations.
Last night Mark Field, Conservative MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, said: 'What we are going to see on the streets of London, I fear, is something akin to a Third World nation, with limousines and BMWs being whisked through the traffic carrying hordes of self-appointed VIPs who have placed a raft of drastic and draconian conditions on us to be able to host the Games, while making life pretty unbearable for thousands of everyday Londoners.

(CNN) -- Ralph Lauren's 2014 holiday ad campaign for its RRL line was raked over the coals on social media this week for its "assimilation aesthetic," featuring what appear to be antique photos of stoic Native Americans dressed in Western attire.
"Ralph Lauren has a longstanding history in celebrating the rich history, importance and beauty of our country's Native American heritage," the company said in a statement.
Ruth Hopkins, a contributor to the site Last Real Indians, took issue with the campaign's use of Native Americans, claiming that the imagery is not only ignorant, it's a harsh reminder of a time of extreme oppression, and even genocide, for the nation's indigenous people.
The policy of cultural assimilation of Native Americans spanned roughly from the 1800s midway into the 20th century as a way to "Americanize" indigenous people through forced English education, sending children away to boarding schools and banning tribal religious traditions.

"This is the beginning of consumer virtual reality," said Brendan Iribe, CEO of Oculus VR, referring to the company's latest prototype, called "Crescent Bay."
The ambition is to revolutionize the way we communicate.

Interestingly, Iribe wants the Oculus Rift to be a beautiful object; even though the user does not see it, other people do, he says: "The more beautiful the product is, the more likely you are to buy it.
Going from traditional computer graphics and interactive environments -- such as those found in today's most advanced video games -- to the virtual reality offered by Oculus' latest technology is like stepping into a brave new world, where the senses are completely invested rather than simply engaged.
The closest equivalent that one might have experienced before is something called "the broken escalator phenomenon." When you approach a broken escalator, despite being fully aware that it's not moving, your body still relays an odd sensation of imbalance as your stride, involuntarily, tries to conform to your experience of a moving one.
"If you're gonna put on these glasses and talk to your friends, you wanna trust your friend network, you wanna make sure that those are really your friends that you're talking to, and Facebook provides that kind of platform," explained Iribe.

Cook’s latest attempt to register an increasingly elusive 26th century will begin on Thursday at Lord’s, where England take on India in the second Investec Test following the bore draw at Trent Bridge.
The England captain has now gone 25 innings – and 16 months – without reaching three figures, and made just five in his only innings on Nottingham’s featherbed before being bowled round his legs and off his thigh pad by seamer Mohammed Shami.
Between March 2008 and February 2009, he went 27 Test innings without a hundred – but that sequence was leavened by 11 half-centuries, while the current drought has brought him only seven fifties and a modest top score of 72.

Facing the strain: The ambulance service in England and Wales is under severe strain and has consistently missed response time targets for the most serious cases since April.
He told BBC Radio 4’s The World This Weekend: ‘If it is not clinically sound then it is not going to progress.’ Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said the plans suggest Jeremy Hunt’s solution to the A&E crisis is to ‘give up and move the goalposts’.

The number of Web surfers in the country grew by nearly 42 percent to 298 million, according to the China Internet Network Information Center's January report.
The rapid growth in China's Internet use can be tied to its swift economic gains and the government's push for the construction of telephone and broadband lines in the country's vast rural areas, the report says.
The Chinese government wants phone and broadband access in each village by 2010.
The move came as several Chinese government agencies, including the Ministry of Public Security, launched a month-long campaign to clean up the Web, according to the state-run Xinhua news service.
That is for the safety, that is for the overall safety of the country and for the freedom of the majority of the people."

Although Liverpool have an interest in Alexis Sanchez, the Chile star is keen to stay one more year at Barcelona which may also frustrate other suitors Arsenal, Manchester United and Juventus.
Real Madrid maintain an interest in Suarez but they have opened preliminary talks with Monaco over a deal for Radamel Falcao.
Liverpool are pressing ahead with deals for Southampton's Adam Lallana, Benfica's Lazar Markovic and Lille's Divock Origi.
Liverpool are unperturbed by Real Madrid's interest with Raheem Sterling.
Suarez, who was initially brought to Anfield in 2011 by Dalglish for £22.8m, has been banned from any football-related activity by FIFA for four months after he appeared to bite Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini in last week's World Cup Group D clash.
Suarez finally apologised to Chiellini on Monday, with some, including Gary Lineker, insisting he was forced to say sorry by his agent to push forward a move to Barcelona.

After fiddling, cranking and grinding his way through a number of prototypes in his Wilmington, North Carolina, studio, Brandis developed a simple machine that could shell nuts up to 50 times faster than by hand.
Designed with a simple, durable hand crank, the "universal nut sheller" could be built with $28 worth of materials.
To give this "gift to the world," Brandis joined forces with a group of former Peace Corps volunteers and co-founded the Full Belly Project in 2003, a nonprofit organization dedicated to designing and distributing technologies like the universal nut sheller.
The Full Belly Project works on four continents in 17 countries.
Hundreds of machines are in use or being produced locally at minimal cost in the Philippines, Uganda and Guatemala, resulting in health benefits and increased family incomes, according to the Full Belly Project.

The British banker accused of murdering two women in Hong Kong was reportedly left 'devastated' when his fiancee cheated on him after she moved to New York for her job.
Cambridge graduate Rurik Jutting has been charged with two counts of murder after one woman's decapitated body was found in a suitcase on the balcony of his luxury flat, and another with her throat slashed.
The former public schoolboy and Cambridge graduate dated a string of beautiful girls from Asia and last year had a relationship with a stunning British fashion student.
Last night fresh claims emerged that he was obsessed with having sex with 'two or three women' and held drug-fuelled sex parties lasting for days at his flat.
But it was also suggested that he had been left 'devastated' when a fellow City trader cheated on him two years ago after the pair had been engaged to be married.
Fashion student: He also dated glamorous British fashion student Sonya Dyer, 29, once said to have described him as her 'hubby'
And it was claimed he had vowed to kill himself because of his ongoing depression.

Such was their lavish lifestyle together, her friends compared the couple to Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie – known by the combined name 'Brangelina' – by calling Rurik and Yanie 'Ruyanie'.
The former public schoolboy and Cambridge graduate dated a string of beautiful girls from Asia and last year had a relationship with a stunning British fashion student.
She said Jutting was a 'good and intelligent' person who had never displayed any signs of violence, although he was 'very strict' with other women – a symptom of his perfectionism and his desire to 'do the right thing'.
Miss Butt, originally from Bury, Lancashire reportedly joined Barclays Capital from Pricewaterhouse Coopers after studying at Imperial College London.

Middle aged women who regularly do aerobics, Zumba or step classes are protecting themselves against breast cancer, research shows.
Around one in eight women in the UK eventually get breast cancer – around 50,500 a year – but there is growing evidence that a healthy lifestyle can hugely lower this risk.
Researchers at Oxford University spent three years following 126,000 women who had been through the menopause, and recorded whether they developed the disease.
Scientists have known for some time that being overweight or obese increases a woman’s risk of breast cancer.
Professor Tim Key, a Cancer Research UK scientist from the cancer epidemiology unit at Oxford University, said: ‘What’s really interesting about this study is that [reduction in breast cancer risk] does not appear to be solely due to the most active women being slimmer, suggesting that there may be some more direct benefits of exercise for women of all sizes.

A simulation (shown) created by the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (Icrar) in Western Australia has revealed the formation of 'Milkomeda'.
This is the name given to the super-galaxy that will be created when the Milky Way and Andromeda collide in 5 billion years
The simulation was created by a number of institutions led by the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (Icrar) in Western Australia.
Based on the immense gravity that would be required to explain the movement of stars and the energy expelled, the centre of the Milky Way is thought to have a supermassive black hole like many other galaxies in the universe.
Some simulations predict that this event will see Earth brought nearer the centre of the combined galaxy before being flung out of the super-galaxy.

Second Model with 2 correct:
The Milky Way is also expected to ‘eat’ two nearby dwarf galaxies, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, at some point in the future.
‘The first passage does little damage to the galaxies; it's on the second and subsequent encounters that gravitational interactions have most effect, with huge clouds of gas undergoing shocks and collapsing to create bursts of star formation that lead to powerful supernovae-driven winds.
Some simulations predict that this event will see Earth brought nearer the centre of the combined galaxy before being flung out of the new super-galaxy
Based on the immense gravity that would be required to explain the movement of stars and the energy expelled, the centre of the Milky Way is thought to have a supermassive black hole like many other galaxies in the universe.
As Andromeda is larger than the Milky Way, with one trillion stars in the former compared to about 300 billion in the latter, it will technically be the one ‘eating’ our galaxy.

(CNN) -- The father of a 9-year-old boy who hopped a flight from Minnesota to Las Vegas last week tearfully told reporters Wednesday that he'd previously asked for help to address the boy's behavior problems, but no one responded.
"Somebody help me, please," the father, who did not reveal his name, told reporters between sobs at a news conference hosted by the MAD DADS fathers' organization in Minneapolis.
A short while later, the video shows that the agent became "distracted," and that's when the boy was able to sneak through and board the plane, he said.
The newspaper reported there is an investigation into whether the boy's mother, who works at the Minneapolis airport, helped him fly to Las Vegas.
The boy also was suspended from school in September because of a fight, according to the dad.

Make an effort with the  in-laws. Aunt Betty might drive you crazy, but getting along will make your partner feel at ease.
Offer to help. If you see your partner is stressed, suggest you take on some more tasks. Be proactive.
Accept that Christmas  and relationships are never perfect. Lower your expectations and accept  that most of the time, it’s  the effort that counts.
Say I love you. It helps.
Start a deep debate when you have been drinking. It  will only lead to tears and unnecessary arguments.
Bring up past problems. Regurgitating previous relationship issues is likely  to taint memories of the entire festive period.
Complain about how much everything costs. Christmas  is expensive but it creates lasting happy memories, so spoil yourselves a bit.
Forget that human contact can say everything, whether holding hands or cuddling on the sofa. Touching is crucial.
Forget to spend quality time together, especially when your house is full of relatives. Let relatives look after the kids while you and your partner go for a walk.
Let issues build up. If you are feeling neglected, ask your partner for a hug  and calmly explain how you feel. Don’t blow up in a tantrum or sulk.

Congress, meanwhile, is debating cuts to food stamps, with Republicans including House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., wanting a $4 billion-a-year reduction to an anti-poverty program that they say promotes dependency and abuse.
Taking into account changing family structure, higher unemployment and policy expansions to the food stamp program, the analysis shows that stagnant wages and income inequality explained just 3.5 per cent of the change in food stamp enrollment from 1980 to 2011.

(CNN) -- Two commuter trains collided head-on Monday evening in western Switzerland, injuring dozens, officials said.
One locomotive's driver was missing after the crash, police said, and search crews were trying to pry open the train's crushed cab.
The collision happened in the village of Granges-prÃ¨s-Marnand, about 8 km (5 miles) south of Payerne, around 6:45 p.m.
Authorities are investigating what caused the crash.
The trains were on a route between Payerne and Lausanne, a city on the shores of Lake Geneva, Schaerli said.
The crash will interrupt train service between Payerne and Moudon -- a city near the line's halfway point -- until at least midnight, Schaerli said.

The book, Lettre Ouverte aux Escrocs de l'Islamophobie qui Font le Jeu des Racistes (Open Letter to the Fraudsters of Islamophobia who Play into Racists' Hands), which may well rock the 'Je Suis Charlie' solidarity over the massacre, argues that some intellectuals who condemned the drawings were merely attention-seekers.
Charb asks why Islamophobia, which technically means ‘fear of Islam’, is being used by activists, media and politicians to denounce hatred of Muslims and wonders why ‘Muslimophobia’ is not used instead, or simply ‘racism’.

During the trial, salacious details about the couple's marriage came out, detailing that purportedly they barely spoke after 38 years of marriage and thus, said the defense, could not have conspired to corrupt.
She wrote a note to Williams saying that she hoped his daughters could wear the dresses after she received them on loan, or that even they could be auctioned for a worthy charity.

London, England (CNN) -- Three-time ATP World Tour Finals champion Boris Becker predicted on Monday that world number two Roger Federer will win the season-ending contest between the men's top eight players, which takes place at the 02 Arena in London this week.
Federer has already had one win over seventh-ranked David Ferrer in the round-robin competition, and will face Great Britain's Andy Murray on Tuesday and Sweden's Robin Soderling on Thursday, before potentially progressing to the semifinal stage.
"He is a proud man, he really wants to end the year on a high and wants to show [world number one Rafael] Nadal that he is still going to be around for next year -- so I actually pick him to win the tournament," the German, champion in1988, 1992 and 1995 told CNN's World Sport program.
"But it is very different to a Grand Slam here -- any match you play in could be a potential Grand Slam final so there are no easy matches."   The six-time major winner added that he did not expect Federer to dominate tennis in the way he has for the last few years, and could expect to be continually challenged by Spanish rival Nadal as well as the other top players.
"Nadal has had one of the greatest years of tennis ever, winning three Grand Slams -- this man is amazing."   Becker also said that he was impressed so far by the performance of Murray -- who beat Soderling in straight sets in his opening match -- despite the pressure on the Scot's shoulders to win on home soil.

The Asov Battalion - which Sydney man Mr Mallah , who was jailed in maximum security for two years before being acquitted of terrorism charges , has applied to join - has set up a Facebook page in its recruitment drive for men to join for a minimum two months .
Australian man Zaky Mallah , 30 ( pictured in his western Sydney apartment with the flag of moderate Syrian rebel group , the Islamic Front ) travelled to Syria in 2012 and went on the frontline with the Free Syrian Army .

Second Model with 1 correct:
While Mr Mallah admits he is looking to join the Asov Revolution in Ukraine partly because the Valdimir Putin-backed Russian rebels are also supporters of the al Assad regime in Syria, he says the Ukrianian group is fighting a legitimate battle to retain its territory for its people.
'It's a revolution and I'd like to join in and kick some Russian a**e, but I want to contribute something useful and go to the front line and help with providing food, cleaning military or humanitarian aid, doing security checks, whatever is required.'
Two years ago Mr Mallah travelled to Syria and lived with the FSA rebels engaged in the bloody civil war against Muslim hardliner President Bashar el Assad 'before it got crazy over there'.
Zaky Mallah said he his happy to obey the Asov Battalion edict that as a volunteer he must get himself to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv (pictured) (Kiev) and prepare to become a fighter, a combat trainer or an interpreter.
Australian man Zaky Mallah, 30 (pictured in his western Sydney apartment with the flag of moderate Syrian rebel group, the Islamic Front) travelled to Syria in 2012 and went on the frontline with the Free Syrian Army.
The Asov Revolution group (pictured, training volunteers this week in Mariupol) says an 'international unit is now under construction in the Mariupol region' on the Black Sea for the battalion which was a division of the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs
Mr Mallah said the Australian Government's laws under the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act which precluded its citizens engaging in 'hostile' acts in foreign countries would not apply to him because he did not intend to engage in actual war.

Baghdad (CNN)Iraq's military abandoned a strategically important base in Anbar province after heavy fighting with ISIS militants, provincial security force sources told CNN on Monday.
The base outside the city of Hit was one of the Shiite-led government's few remaining military outposts in Anbar, a predominantly Sunni province that has increasingly fallen under ISIS control.
It is a key control point for roads running through the region.
Meanwhile in Syria, fighting continues in the key Kurdish border city of Kobani, which ISIS has been trying to seize for weeks.
The fighter said the Kurdish fighters had pushed back an attempted advance by ISIS on Monday morning but that it would be "impossible" for them to hold their ground if current conditions continued.

military said it and partner nations had attacked ISIS in Syria on Sunday and Monday, launching four airstrikes southwest of Kobani, three northeast of the city and one northwest of Raqqa.
Should all of Anbar fall, the Sunni extremists would rule from the perimeter of Iraq's capital to Raqqa in Syria, at least, according to the provincial council's deputy head, Falleh al-Issawi.
A fighter from the Kurdish People's Protection Unit, or YPG, told CNN's Arwa Damon that the battle was focusing on the main border crossing into Turkey.

A spokesman for Mango said: 'In view of the controversy surrounding the launch of Violeta by MANGO, the company would like to reiterate that Violeta by MANGO is a new brand within the group which was created to cover an existing demand in the market by offering a fashion collection in sizes that extend up to 24.
But while the Government and fashion editors have celebrated the collection, Mango has been accused by shoppers on Twitter of stigmatising women larger than a size 10, and even encouraging eating disorders.
'What differentiates said brand is the attention to technical details, pattern to pattern and size to size, and the selection of garment materials and fabrics, which have been produced to be more comfortable, feminine and modern.
'The key characteristic of this line is the personalisation of the collection to a new target market, the result of painstaking work and effort on the silhouette and pattern of each size.'
Jenny Willott, Minister for Women and Equalities, told The Times: 'Diversity makes good business sense - research shows that plus-size women are frustrated by the poor choice of fashion available to them and embarrassed by retail environments that separate them from other women.

Jerry Lee Brock, 55, had been in prison since his conviction for first-degree molestation in 1995.

He was sentenced to life in prison under the state's 'three-strikes' law; he also had convictions for burglary and promoting prostitution.

Volkswagen's British arm had sought in vain in the mid 1990s to change the name in the UK of its first people-mover called the 'Sharan' fearing it sounded too close to 'Sharon' and had connotations of the downmarket 'Kev and Sharon' from Essex.

The Provo is powered by a turbo-charged 1.6 T-GDi 204 horse-power petrol engine linked to a smart four-wheel-drive hybrid electric system that can add another 45 horse-power surge to the rear wheels as required and also allowing low-speed electric-only motion.

Qaqoortoq, Greenland (CNN) -- Greenland is an autonomous territory that is partially administered by Denmark.
It is the largest Island in the world and was discovered around 982 by an explorer named Eric the Red who had been exiled from Iceland for murder for three years.
That is significant because Eric the Red sailed to Greenland in a small wooden boat, but nowadays the area around Greenland is covered all year with pack ice and icebergs.
So many researchers have come to the conclusion that temperatures in Greenland must have been much higher in the 10th century than they are today.
Greenlandic potatoes, cabbage, and a variety of herbs have become common in supermarkets on the island.
Global warming may very well be a threat to humanity, but here in Greenland it seems to be pushing this country back to what it was when it was discovered by the traveler Erik the Red.

He has also captured microscopic images of crystals, from sugar to paracetamol and Vitamin C, and created images of women and animals using smoke.
To take such precise shots, Augusteijn’s uses a pool of water that is lit from various angles, with coloured lights used to add hues to the drops.
When this drop reaches a certain point, the gun is set to fire automatically, which in turn triggers the camera’s flash and shutter.

There was Andrew Flintoff trotting out at the Gabba to join the England team for the first time since limping into Ashes immortality at the Oval almost six years ago.
Former England cricketer Andrew Flintoff bowls during a nets session at The Gabba
It will not lead to a playing return for his country, of course, and Flintoff restricted himself to barely half an hour’s bowling at just Chris Jordan and Chris Woakes during his day back with the England team at Peter Moores invitation.
But such is the enduring appeal of the man known as Freddie that all eyes were on him as he donned mitts to assist with a boxing training exercise and then took up his position at the back of the nets, passing on advice to England’s bowlers.

But the man who has made only a modest impact with a Brisbane Heat team who have now been knocked out of this year’s Big Bash could not resist a bit of a trundle after passing on some advice to Steven Finn, who looked a detached figure and seems sure to be the bowler to miss out when Anderson returns.
England intended Flintoff’s day among them to be a low-key affair and the first of a number of visits from past greats aimed, as is the wont of Australia under Darren Lehmann, at encouraging a bit of star dust to rub off on the team.

New York attorney Caitlin Halligan is one of two nominees named in January by Obama to the U.S.
"Rather than debate the merits of her nomination and whether she has the legal ability, judgment, character, ethics and temperament to serve on the court, Senate Republicans resorted to smearing her distinguished record of service," said Sen.
Halligan has a well-documented record of advocating extreme positions on constitutional issues, pushing legal arguments beyond what I think is reasonable, including in cases involving Second Amendment gun rights, abortion, the death penalty and others," said Sen.
In a rare move, Senate Republicans voted in December 2011 to block Halligan the first time she was tapped for the appeals court, complaining that the 46-year-old Ohio native was too liberal and would bring her "extreme" political views to the bench.
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday reiterated the view of many of his colleagues that Halligan met the "extraordinary circumstances" standard, under a 2005 Senate agreement that allowed filibusters of judicial nominees only in extreme cases.

(CNN) -- The husband of one of the members of Russian punk rock band Pussy Riot imprisoned for hooliganism in Moscow is leading a chorus of condemnation after a conviction decried as an attack on free speech.
They were arrested after performing a song critical of President Vladimir Putin in one of the Russian Orthodox Church's most important cathedrals in February, a flash mob-style act that outraged many of the country's faithful.
Verzilov said the authorities had crossed "a certain line" in arresting the women for a nonviolent protest act -- and that this was the reason for the international outcry over the case, with celebrities including Madonna backing their cause.
"While we understand the group's behavior was offensive to some, we have serious concerns about the way that these young women have been treated by the Russian judicial system," he said.
Amnesty believes that the women's conduct "was politically motivated, and that they were wrongfully prosecuted for what was a legitimate -- if potentially offensive -- protest action," it said in a statement.

"Together with the reports of the band members' mistreatment during their pre-trial detention and the reported irregularities of the trial, it puts a serious question mark over Russia's respect for international obligations of fair, transparent and independent legal process," she said.
Footage of the brief but provocative protest action, in which the band members clad in balaclavas screamed "Mother Mary, please drive Putin away," inside Christ Savior Cathedral attracted wide attention after it was posted online.
Urging Russia to reverse the sentence, Ashton said the case "adds to the recent upsurge in politically motivated intimidation and prosecution of opposition activists in the Russian Federation, a trend that is of growing concern to the European Union."
Inside the courtroom, Judge Marina Sirovaya found the three Pussy Riot members guilty of offending the churchgoers present -- through their actions, obscene language and their clothing -- and showing a lack of respect for the rules of the Orthodox Church.

While others defended Charlie Hebdo's decision, saying that it needed to be done to ensure that the 'violent' do not have control over 'liberal civilization'.
Finally, he states that the massacre should be viewed as 'a clash of extremist fringes', apparently referring to the Islamic fundamentalists on one side and the team at Charlie Hebdo on the other.

Proctor, who was given an antisocial behaviour order (Asbo) last month and barred from her regular haunts including shopping centres, was evicted from her terraced house after neighbours complained that she held all-night parties.
Natalie Whittaker from Lancashire Police said after the case: 'This Asbo is an excellent result for local residents who were being kept up until all hours because of noise and excessive drinking by Rebecca Proctor.

It takes an extra moment for Petra Vujevic to break free from her chair, where she is surrounded by three stylists trying to tame her long blonde hair into a "punky ballerina" bun.
It's just something she decided to try by taking a year off from university in Croatia, where she's studying computer science.
"When you're tall and thin, everyone says you should be a model, so I thought: try it for a year," Vujevic said in accented English, which she learned in school and from television.
Vujevic may not be the typical small-town girl trying to make it in the big city, but her story underscores the bigger picture in the post-supermodel era, when girls are cycled in and out with each season and only a rare few stick around to become bold-face names.

It's completely different from Rachel Antonoff's garden party-themed presentation Sunday, in which Vujevic's prop was a badminton racket, or the Christine Alcalay presentation earlier that day, which was staged in a 1,000-square-foot studio in an office building.
Vujevic thought she would have a stretch of time for lunch -- modeling makes her hungry, she says -- but as she's leaving the studio, her agency sends an e-mail letting her know that she has a fitting for Gerlan Jeans, so she heads downtown.
With their hair and makeup in various states of readiness, they look like a disheveled flock of flamingos stepping to the beat of singer/designer Avril Lavigne, who is nowhere in sight even though the show bears the Canadian rocker's name and her brand's imprint, Abbey Dawn.

But while this burst of online chatter will undoubtedly affect the coverage and analysis of the debates, the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates has, unfortunately, taken only the most modest of steps to channel all of this public participation into something more meaningful than a digital water-cooler conversation.
A week ago, the debate commission announced "The Voice Of...," a digital platform that will be deployed on special landing pages hosted by Google, Yahoo and AOL to "give people throughout the country the opportunity to share their voice." Now, a day before the first debate, I've gotten a peek at the dashboard they're delivering, from the Yahoo page that has just gone live (the others are still placeholders).
This is very nice, and it will certainly be interesting to see how the live debate affects the results on "The Voice Of..." dashboards.
After all, the dirty little secret about the Commission on Presidential Debates is that is essentially a creature of the two major parties that views its job as managing an orderly joint television appearance that both major presidential campaigns will agree to.

( CNN ) -- On Wednesday night , an estimated 50 million Americans will watch the first presidential debate live , as President Barack Obama and GOP nominee Mitt Romney face off for 90 minutes in Denver .
The odds are that many of those watching will have more than their TVs on as they do so : Millions are also likely to be glancing at their laptops or mobile phones , scanning the live conversation about the debates that will unfold over social networks and chiming in with their own comments .
Despite all kinds of interesting experiments during the primaries , including questions from the audience via Twitter and inviting real-time feedback that moderators occasionally inserted into the live debate conversation , the commission is rolling out a quasi-interactive online tool that is bound to leave the public wanting much more .

If the presidential campaigns can go so far as to prohibit a live audience member in a town-hall-style debate from even asking a follow-up question, which is something that would happen naturally if it was a genuine town hall, then it's understandable why the commission's approach to the Internet is so compartmentalized and limited.

Unlike the shuttle, the new rocket has to be powerful enough to get out of low Earth orbit and carry humans to an asteroid and eventually Mars, perhaps even the moon.
Its first new rocket in 40 years may not happen because the agency doesn't think the $8 billion budgeted over the next three years is enough.
The $9 billion was for the now-defunct Constellation program, planned to take astronauts to the moon and on to Mars.

If he were able to speak to a psychologist, it's possible he would be diagnosed as suffering from anxiety disorder, a common problem among migrant workers, according to Professor Cheng Yu at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou.
Cheng and his colleagues interviewed 807 migrant workers in the Shenzhen area and had in-depth conversations with 60 of them.
In 2010, the issue made international headlines after a spate of worker suicides at Foxconn, a large electronic manufacturer that assembles many Apple products, making the professor determined to find out the root causes of the workers' mental health problems.
Though the focus of Cheng's research was in the southern province of Guangdong, the mental health of migrants is likely to be similar elsewhere in the country.
Despite their contribution to China's economic miracle, the social status of these migrant workers remains low.
Throughout the world, research suggests that migrant workers are more likely to experience mental illness than those who stay behind as they adjust to a new environment without their families and social support groups.
Better-educated and internet savvy, younger migrants like Zheng suffer more from this urban-rural divide than their elders.

The vaccines contain a trace of Ebola virus that helps trigger an immune response against the virus, according to a document from Prevail, the acronym for Partnership for Research on Ebola Vaccines in Liberia, as the US-Liberia collaboration is called.
The UN health agency said last week that the three worst-affected countries - Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia - have reported fewer than 100 cases in the past week, for the first time since June.
The Royal Free, said in a statement: 'We can confirm that a second UK military healthcare worker has been admitted to the Royal Free Hospital today following a needlestick injury while working in Sierra Leone.
Three other hospitals - The Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne Royal Victoria Infirmary and Sheffield Teaching Hospitals - are designated centres for escalation if more patients are diagnosed with Ebola.
It is thought the medic was working at the Kerry Town treatment centre, 40km from Freetown and that the injury happened within 48 hours of their being flown home.

Ray Massey tested the new 5-door Ford Focus Zetec (pictured) this week and was impressed by the car's simple interior and streamlined exterior styling
Golden Globewinning actor and car fan Idris Elba — star of the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom — has been putting Jaguar's new XE compact salon through its paces before it goes on sale in June priced from £26,995.
As well as driving an XE from London to Berlin for a four-part documentary, he's taken part in a high-octane test at Spa, Belgium, with the help of ex-F1 driver Martin Brundle.
Prime Minister David Cameron welcomed Rolls-Royce's official announcement that it's to build its first ever 4x4, creating hundreds of new jobs.
He was present as the firm announced the multi-million pound investment at its Goodwood factory, in West Sussex, on Wednesday and hailed it as a huge vote of confidence in the UK and its economy.
He said: 'The Government will do everything we can to support you because it is something the country needs more of.' The new super-luxury offroader (as imagined by Auto Express above) is set to go into production within three years, adding to a line-up which includes the Phantom and Ghost limousines and variants, plus the Wraith fastback.
It will be a high-bodied allterrain vehicle with all-new aluminium architecture, which Rolls-Royce says is 'worthy of carrying the Spirit of Ecstasy into the future'.

Abstractive Summary:
The company have put a great deal of attention to detail into this model
The new Zetec is both effortless and nimble to drive
Ford have listened to their customers and simplified the car's interior
Were it not for a Press leak, this would be a test of the latest version of the Ford Fusion. That was the name planned for the mid-size hatchback, which in 1998 replaced the longrunning Escort. But Ford's then boss, the mercurial Jac Nasser, was so incensed that the cat had got out of the bag, he changed the name and revealed it just seconds before the curtains came up at its Geneva Motor Show launch. Now with 12 million sold worldwide, we're on the third generation.
Ford does so many things without fuss that it's easy to take its cars for granted. A big mistake. The company puts a great deal of attention to detail into each model. So this newcomer is both effortless and nimble to drive, but also engaging, thanks to a crisp six-speed manual gearbox linked to a willing, yet frugal and award-winning, 1-litre 125bhp EcoBoost engine.
The base price of the car I drove was £18,795, but it came with a few extras including Frozen White paint (£250), door edge protectors (£85), but most significantly the Ford Sync2 DAB navigation system (£500) with a big 8in touch-screen with on the central dashboard. It includes a splitscreen display, voice-control of audio, satnav, climate control and mobile phones, spoken street names, 3-D highway, junction and landmark views and even the Michelin guide. A chunk of money, but well worth it.
The ergonomics make it easy to sit in and drive. Buttons tend to be where you want them.
Ford said it's listened to customers who asked for simplicity inside the car with fewer controls and switches to navigate around.
So a sensible de-clutter results in a cleaner, more modern feel to the interior with black satin trim and chrome detailing. Sufficient space in the back. The boot is big enough for the weekly shop.
Good economy at around 60mpg — almost 50mpg in town, helped by stop-start technology. Acceleration from rest to 62 mph is 11 seconds which, while it won't break any speed records, is fine for family motoring. CO2 emissions are low at 108g/km.
My Zetec trim level is the third of six which range from basic Studio to Style, Zetec, Zetec S, Titanium and Titanium X. Standard equipment includes 16 in alloy wheels, a quick-clear heated windscreen, air conditioning, remote central locking, hill-start assist, Thatcham category 1 alarm, halogen headlamps, sports-style front seats and a driver-seat lumbar adjust.
Exterior styling has been refined to make it look more streamlined, but the main brief seems to have been, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Up against tough competition such as the Volkswagen Golf which, although more expensive, is a hard act to follow.
There are some handy parking aids on offer, which use ultrasonic sensors to locate parking spaces and steer the car into them automatically. Sadly on the model I tested, they were not fitted.
Having plumped for a midrange model, you might ask what else is on offer. Beyond the standard Titanium X trim there's the 135mph ST, with its 250 bhp 2-litre EcoBoost petrol engine, which hits showrooms this month from £22,195. There's also a 185 bhp diesel with a top speed of 135mph and 19in alloys, and a high-performance 320 bhp 2.3-litre allwheel drive RS — the 30th vehicle to wear the RS badge since 1968.

(CNN) -- More than 300 relatives and friends of missing Flight MH370 passengers marched to the Malaysian Embassy in Beijing Tuesday to express their anger and frustration with Malaysian authorities.
Earlier, the protesters had walked on foot from the Lido Hotel, near Beijing's International Airport, after police prevented them from boarding buses to the embassy.
The protesters left the embassy on buses on Tuesday afternoon after a Malaysian official accepted a petition letter from the families.
"No amount of compensation or consolation will make up for any loss of life," Malaysia Airlines Chairman Mohamad Nor Yusof said Tuesday.
Visa fees will be waived for the families of MH370 passengers and crew flying in to Australia, the country's defense minister David Johnston said Tuesday.

When Kitty Buchanan-Gregory saw her GP about dizzy spells, she could tell she wasn't being taken seriously - and she could understand why.
'I was 30, didn't smoke, ate healthily, drank little and trained with my rowing club five times a week,' says Kitty, now 39, a business project manager from Battersea, South London.
Kitty had a 'heart block', a condition common in elderly people, and a natural result of ageing, but which can occur in the young, too.

Instead, the heart keeps beating only thanks to cells in the ventricles stimulating a heartbeat - but because this kind of heartbeat has an extremely low rate, it can affect blood flow, leading to a raised risk of fatigue, dizziness, light-headedness, blackouts and cardiac arrest.
The dizzy spells continued and, over the next three years, Kitty returned to her GP practice four times, seeing different doctors, who agreed it was probably stress.
'The more physically fit a person, the higher their “vagal tone”, which means it acts even more as a brake, lowering  heart rate so the  electrical impulses are slow.' Other causes of first and second-degree heart block include inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis - usually caused by a virus), or low levels of potassium or magnesium in the blood, caused by extreme dieting, kidney conditions, damage from heart attack and Lyme disease (a bacterial infection spread by ticks).Some heart and blood-pressure medicines - including calcium channel blockers and digoxin - can also delay electrical signals passing through the atrioventricular node (which electrically connects the upper and lower chambers of the heart).

Best bet: Brazil 1/3, Draw 4/1, Mexico 10/1
Managers: Luiz Felipe Scolari (Brazil)Miguel Herrera (Mexico)
Great expectations: Luiz Felipe Scolari oversees Brazil training in Fortaleza on Monday
Brazil’s creator in chief was at his best against Croatia, scrapping in midfield, grabbing a goal and assist and playing a part in another goal.
His tendency to drop deep makes him difficult to mark and his injury troubles in the second half of the season appear to have left him fresh to star for the Selecao.
Fred took some criticism for the way he went down against Croatia and Marquez will need to be wary not to get too close to the Brazil frontman whilst also making sure he does not provide a platform for Neymar to star again coming in from the left.
A difficult job but one the four-time World Cup captain will relish.

Decatur, Georgia (CNN) -- A former Georgia sheriff's deputy convicted of murder in the slaying of his wife and a day laborer in 2008 was sentenced Friday to two consecutive life sentences plus five years in prison.
That means that Derrick Yancey, 51, will have to serve at least 60 years before he is eligible for parole.

The wife of Justin Ross Harris, the Georgia man who faces a murder charge after leaving his 22-month-old son Cooper to die in a scorching hot SUV last month, has hired her own attorney.
The news come as her husband’s employer Home Depot confirmed that it has fired him from his job as a web developer.
Company spokeswoman Catherine Woodling confirmed on Thursday that Justin Ross Harris no longer works for the company but wouldn't say when he was terminated.
A growing number of questions are being asked about Leanna Harris' unusual behavior in the wake of young Cooper’s horrific death inside a sweltering SUV last month.
Harris, a 30-year-old dietitian, expressed little emotion throughout her husband's preliminary hearing last week, despite a number of shocking allegations including that her husband had been sexting with six different women, some teenagers, on the day their young son had passed away.
When informed by workers at her son’s day care facility that Cooper had never been dropped off, she calmly responded, ‘Ross must have left him in the car.
Then, when reunited with her husband at police headquarters after he had been charged with murder, Leanna Harris asked him, ‘Did you say too much?’ according to Stoddard.
Police had previously disclosed that, like her husband, she had researched children dying in hot vehicles prior to her son Cooper’s death, telling officers it was her ‘worst fear.’
The 250 or so mourners who gathered at University Church of Christ gave her two rounds of applause as she said she wouldn’t bring her son back, even if she could.

The Australian housing market is  between 20 to 30 percent overvalued, leaving Australia open to an international economic shock, warns a leading senior Australian economic expert.

'A high debt-to-income ratio leaves households much more vulnerable to income and interest rate shocks,' he said.

But how has the steadily increasing rollout of speed cameras in some 35 cities and more than 300 communities nationwide affected drivers?
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that speed is a factor in about a third of all traffic deaths, which total about 13,000 annually.
Common arguments against the cameras suggest that while speed cameras will cut speeds, this can lead to "bunching," which can result in more accidents if drivers are taken by surprise by others slowing down quickly to avoid a fine.
He said that most speed cameras are catching drivers driving fast at night, which is the safest time of the day to drive since here is less traffic and roads frequently are clear.
But we found in our surveys that, in D.C., 51 percent of drivers favored [speed cameras] and 36 percent apposed them," he noted.

AOL Autos: Cars with the most thrill per gallon
As well as raising revenue, a speed-camera system can free up officers from patrol duties to concentrate on other beats (which leads to criticism that police may be less inclined to patrol a section of road with a camera, leading to fewer arrests of drunken or reckless drivers).
A 2005 review from the IIHS analyzed data from 14 studies and found crash reductions in the immediate vicinities of camera sites, ranging from 5 to 69 percent for all crashes, 12 to 65 percent for injury crashes, and 17 to 71 percent for fatal crashes.
Chad Dornsife, formerly of the National Motorists Association and now head of the Oregon-based Best Highway Safety Practices Institute, an advocacy group for "fact-based safety policies," disagrees.

Liverpool are giving serious consideration to making a move for Chelsea defender Ryan Bertrand as Brendan Rodgers attempts to fill the club’s troublesome left-back position.
The Spanish left-back was one Rodgers’ principal targets at the beginning of the summer but Liverpool are reluctant to meet Sevilla’s asking price, after they demanded a deal in excess of £20million for the 21-year-old defender.
Bertrand, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, would be rather more affordable at around £8m and the player is understood to be keen on a move to a club playing Champions League football.
Liverpool endured major difficulties at left-back last season following the injury to Jose Enrique and the disappointing form of Aly Cissokho, although John Flanagan did impress in the final few months of the season.

The Obama administration will not make a formal determination as to whether the ouster of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy by the military was a coup, a senior administration official told CNN's Jill Dougherty on Thursday.
A coup determination would force the United States to end military aid to Egypt.
The news, first reported by The Associated Press, came as Egypt braced for rival rallies set for Friday by Morsy's supporters and those who backed his ouster by the military.
Morsy, Egypt's first democratically elected president, has not been seen publicly since he was pushed from office by the military on July 3 after mass protests over his leadership and suspended the constitution.
He is calling the protests a "mandate" for the military after weeks of violence that he has blamed on Morsy's supporters, primarily the Muslim Brotherhood.

The Obama administration will not make a formal determination as to whether the ouster of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy by the military was a coup, a senior administration official told CNN's Jill Dougherty on Thursday.
The country is considered a vital regional ally for the United States, which signaled its displeasure with Morsy's ouster on Wednesday when the Pentagon said it was delaying the delivery of four F-16 fighter jets.
The news, first reported by The Associated Press, came as Egypt braced for rival rallies set for Friday by Morsy's supporters and those who backed his ouster by the military.
Morsy, Egypt's first democratically elected president, has not been seen publicly since he was pushed from office by the military on July 3 after mass protests over his leadership and suspended the constitution.

In a shift, the Cuban government says it will allow its athletes to play professionally abroad, ostensibly to shore up the competitiveness of its national teams.
But it cannot be overlooked that lucrative contracts for Cuban athletes abroad would benefit the state through taxation.
Whether the new policy, announced through state media on Friday, will open a floodgate of talented Cuban athletes to the United States will have to be seen.
Until now, defection has been the common path for Cuban athletes who want to compete abroad.
In practice, Cuban athletes are more likely to end up in leagues in countries other than the United States.
Baseball is king in Cuba, and Major League Baseball would be a coveted destination for many Cuban athletes.
Another hurdle for athletes is the migration reform that went into effect in Cuba this year that still requires athletes to seek government approval to travel abroad.

The opening of opportunities to make money abroad seems like a recognition of the lucrative market for athletes, but Granma explained it as an affirmation of Karl Marx's slogan: "From each according to his ability, to each according to his need."
The Cuban government envisions its athletes paying taxes on money earned anywhere abroad, but if that money is made in the United States, sending it to the communist nation would violate a longstanding economic embargo, a U.S.
Los Angeles Dodgers' star Yasiel Puig, for instance, defected from Cuba in 2012 and signed a seven-year, $42 million contract.

The Kop expects big-money recruits to make an immediate mark and the fact Lallana, having only just recovered from medial ligament damage, was rusty in his first couple of games against Aston Villa and Ludogorets, did not go unnoticed — most notably by the man himself.
Such was Lallana’s determination to make a positive impression that he stayed in America with the rest of Liverpool’s touring squad rather than heading home for treatment after being injured during a training session.
Slowly but surely, Lallana seems to be finding his stride and he made a difference when coming on as a substitute against West Ham and during the 120 minutes he played against Middlesbrough in the Capital One cup.
‘Everton always seemed to be fighting relegation when I was supporting them,’ says Lallana, whose childhood hero was goalkeeper Neville Southall.

Mr Jarvis, the Shadow Justice Minister, is rapidly gaining support on the party back benches as a ‘clean skin’ candidate who, unlike many rivals, was not an adviser or Minister during the Blair or Brown governments and is ‘untainted’ by association with Mr Miliband’s inner circle.
In any leadership contest, Mr Jarvis is likely to face the more experienced figures of health spokesman Andy Burnham, Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna, education spokesman Tristram Hunt and ambitious frontbencher Liz Kendall.

Obama's order directs the NIH to develop revised guidelines on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research within 120 days, according to Dr.
"The president is, in effect, allowing federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research to the extent that it's permitted by law -- that is, work with stem cells themselves, not the derivation of stem cells," Varmus said in a conference call with reporters Sunday.
The issue of whether to lift the ban on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research has, however, exposed a clear rift between the more moderate and conservative factions of the GOP.
Former first lady Nancy Reagan also issued a statement Monday thanking Obama for lifting the ban.
President Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease after leaving office -- an affliction that many scientists say eventually may be cured with the help of embryonic stem cell research.

While conceding that "the full promise of stem cell research remains unknown" and "should not be overstated," Obama nevertheless expressed hope that the order will help spur faster progress in the search for cures to afflictions such as Parkinson's disease, cancer and spinal cord injuries.

(CNN) -- Australian authorities will announce a new search area Wednesday in the hunt for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, according to the agency overseeing the effort.
The Australian Transport Safety Bureau said Sunday it's been re-examining data that could shift the search area hundreds of kilometers south along an arc derived from satellite data.
Zaharie was the prime suspect," she said, refuting an article in London's The Sunday Times that says Zaharie is now the sole focus of the investigation.
The article cites unnamed industry and non-Malaysian government sources familiar with the state of the investigation as claiming that Zaharie is "the prime suspect if the plane's disappearance turns out to be the result of human intervention."
The Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which is leading the search at the request of the Malaysian government, said it is accepting proposals for the task until the end of June.

Air crash investigators examining a computer belonging to Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz are trying to determine whether the killer 'spiked' his captain's drink to force him into the toilet.
Investigators have been scouring Lubitz's computers to determine his state of mind before the tragedy
Once Captain Sodenheimer closed the cockpit door, Lubitz enabled special security features preventing the reinforced door from reopening.
The safety systems were introduced following the 9/11 attacks although the designers did not consider a rogue pilot seeking to kill himself while taking his passengers and fellow crew with him.
Already it has emerged that Lubitz used his computer to research methods of killing himself as well as information concerning the cockpit door locking mechanism.
Investigators believe that Lubitz, 27, informed its flight school when he returned from a several-month break in pilot training in 2009 that he had experienced an episode of 'severe depression'.

Then came the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
Johnson 47 years ago Monday, the Voting Rights Act empowered the federal government to oversee elections in states with racially discriminatory voting practices, and outlawed the use of literacy tests for all American voters.
Without protests by citizens who willingly confronted hatred and intimidation from furious mobs, as well as assault from billy clubs and fire hoses, it's doubtful that the Voting Rights Act would have ever passed.
Driven by nearly all Republican legislatures (Rhode Island, which has a Democratic-controlled legislature, is the lone exception), last year 34 states introduced voter ID laws with similar requirements, creating barriers for the 11% of voting-age Americans who lack state-issued photo IDs.

Steven Gerrard announced he will quit Liverpool at the end of the season to play in the United States
What makes it even more remarkable is that Gerard went through that Champions League-winning season feeling unwanted by Liverpool, unsure about the direction in which the club was going, and with his family witnessing disgusting abuse towards him from Liverpool fans.
Throughout the 2004-05 season, while Gerrard was ripping up trees across Europe, Liverpool failed to put a new contract on the table for him, yet Rafa Benitez was in his ear telling him to sign a new deal.

That's the FA Cup," said Roberto Martinez after his Wigan Athletic team made their dream come true with a shock win against Manchester City on Saturday.
Whelan was a former footballer who played in the FA Cup final for Blackburn in 1960, but badly broke his leg as his team lost, and never featured with a top team after that.
"What an incredible story," Martinez said after an injury-time header from substitute Ben Watson earned a shock 1-0 victory over City, who had Pablo Zabaleta sent off for a second yellow card in the 85th minute.
Ferguson's surprise announcement this week that he is retiring after more than 26 years in charge took much of the focus off the FA Cup final, but the buildup to the match came with widespread rumors that Mancini will be replaced by former Real Madrid coach Manuel Pellegrini, who guided Malaga to the Champions League quarterfinals this season.
Mancini helped City end a long wait for a trophy when he won the FA Cup in his first season in charge, but Saturday's defeat could be the end of the road for the 48-year-old after a difficult season in which he sold problematic striker Mario Balotelli -- who he had signed in 2010 from his former club Inter Milan -- and failed to make it past the group stage in the Champions League.
Earlier Saturday, Frank Lampard became Chelsea's all-time leading scorer with both goals in a 2-1 victory over Aston Villa that all but ensured the London side will play in the Champions League next season.

Merseyside Police have withdrawn a legal challenge to the kick-off time of Saturday's Everton versus Liverpool derby at Goodison Park.
Goodison Park, Everton's home ground, will host the Merseyside derby against Liverpool on Saturday
But at South Sefton Magistartes Court on Tuesday morning they withdrew that appeal following assurances from Everton that they would improve segregation at the eagerly-anticipated clash.
A Merseyside Police spokesman said that all parties would meet within 28 days to ensure similar issues did not arise in future.
Deputy Chief Constable Andy Cooke, said: 'Our opposition around the late kick-off time has been constant throughout and our paramount concern has always been the safety of those attending the game.
The force accepts that any change to the kick-off time at this stage would have considerable inconvenience for those fans who were going to the game.
Merseyside Police believe the derby clash at Goodison Park should kick-off earlier than 5.30pm on Saturday
'Our request to move the kick-off time is in no way a reflection of the behaviour of fans from either club, as the majority of people who attend the games are genuine fans who go to enjoy the football and have a good time.

The independent review released Tuesday examining attacks that occurred last September 11 cites "systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies" at the State Department.
"The report makes clear the massive failure of the State Department at all levels, including senior leadership, to take action to protect our government employees abroad," said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican.
John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, who is considered the top prospect for the secretary of state job being vacated by Clinton, said the State Department "has taken a huge step forward to address the lessons learned from Benghazi."
A CNN/ORC poll conducted Monday and Tuesday suggests most Americans are dissatisfied with how the Obama administration has handled the aftermath of the attack, but a majority believe that the administration did not attempt to intentionally mislead the American public about that attack.
Four in 10 Americans believe that inaccurate statements by administration officials after the Benghazi attack were intended to mislead the public, while 56% said they thought those statements reflected what the Obama administration believed to be true at the time.
In all, 43% said they are satisfied with the way the Obama administration has handled the matter in the past few months; half said they are dissatisfied.

In 2012, the Alba prosecutor told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that Miss Battilana never showed up to talk to them about her police complaint so they were unable to verify her claims.
A source close to The Weinstein Company told Page Six the groping allegations were nothing more than a 'blackmail attempt' and insisted that the award-winning producer 'did nothing wrong'.

Randall Balmer supports Obama's unusual broadening of a president's words to include nonbelievers.
"Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," the First Amendment to the United States Constitution reads.
More recently, we have talked about the "Abrahamic Traditions," Jews, Christians and Muslims, thereby broadening the circle to include Islam, one of the three major monotheistic religions.
When President Obama declared, "We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus and nonbelievers," he sent a signal that it's time, once again, to enlarge the circle of inclusiveness, consistent with the great American tradition of equality and toleration.
Although I'm sure that Buddhists and Jains and Sikhs and countless other religious adherents would like to have been included in the president's roll call, the message was clear: We are a diverse nation, and the "free exercise" of religion guaranteed in the First Amendment also protects the exercise of no religion at all.

Randall Balmer: It's unusual for a president to include nonbelievers in his words

In the context of the New World , these religious groups learned to coexist with remarkably little conflict , and when it came time to configure the new nation , the founders in their wisdom elected not to designate any group as the state religion .

Research shows that having a hysteroscopy to check the womb before fertility treatment makes no difference to success rates.
But some private clinics insist on the invasive procedure, which costs up to £3,000 a time, before giving IVF.
The procedure – often under general anaesthetic – uses a narrow tube with a camera at the end to send images to a computer, where they can be checked for problems such as scar tissue that may cause infertility.
The take-home baby rate was 31 per cent in the hysteroscopy group and 29 per cent in women who had IVF alone.
Dr El-Toukhy said the finding suggested the abnormalities discovered had ‘little clinical significance’ and were not interfering with the woman’s chances of getting pregnant.

Blow: Newcastle United attacking midfielder Siem de Jong has been ruled out for 'a number of months'
But news of De Jong’s injury - a thigh complaint which will seem him sidelined for ‘a number of months’ - is a bitter blow for Pardew in the same week Jack Colback was forced to withdraw from the England squad because of a calf problem.
Despite bringing in seven players during the summer, including £6million De Jong from Ajax, former Newcastle and England defender Steve Howey believes United have left themselves exposed in key areas.

‘The first thing Kevin did every morning was to tell David how much he loved him,’ said Lee.

Fans of Radio 4’s The Archers have called for the BBC to take the show back to basics in the wake of its editor’s departure.
But although she has increased ratings, she has been heavily criticised for ‘sexing up’ the show unnecessarily.
Miss Whitburn’s overhaul initially led to the popular show achieving record ratings in 2005 due to its ‘Who’s the daddy?’ storyline involving brothers Ed and William Grundy and William’s wife Emma.
Yesterday fans of the show posted comments on its website, underneath the announcement of Miss Whitburn’s departure, calling for the programme to return to its roots as a ‘simple story’ about rural and agricultural matters.

By using two large, white pieces of card, you can project the eclipse's image onto one piece, while using the other to fit around your telescope's tube to act as a mask to shield your eyes from the sun.
The Penryn Primary Academy Cornwall says it is broadcasting the event for children in the school hall, Lasswade Primary School in Bonnyrigg, Midlothian are also keeping students indoors and Bishop Vesey's Grammar School in Birmingham is screening it on TV in the afternoon to all but Year 7 students, who will be allowed outside.

Beccles, England (CNN) -- WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said Friday that the sexual misconduct charges against him are little more than an effort to discredit him and his organization.
"This has been a very successful smear campaign so far, but I think its days are numbered and people are starting to wonder, is what is claimed really true and if it is true, where is the evidence?," Assange told NBC's Today show.
Assange, who was released from a British jail on bail Thursday pending extradition proceedings involving sexual misconduct allegations in Sweden, said the technological and legal attacks on his website are diverting resources from its core mission.
Assange was released Thursday after a British court rejected an appeal on behalf of Swedish authorities to keep him jailed pending an extradition hearing.

Assange must stay at the mansion of a supporter outside London, report to the police daily, wear an electronic tag to monitor his location, and put up 200,000 pounds (about $310,000) in bail money, plus two 20,000-pound sureties (about $31,000 each), the judge ruled.

Two people told Press TV there were no security forces in the area when Neda Agha-Soltan, 26, was killed on June 20.
Neda's death was captured on amateur video -- most likely by a cell phone -- and posted online.
Eyewitnesses say Neda was shot by pro-government Basij militiamen perched on a rooftop.
But Press TV said the type of bullet that killed her is not used by Iranian security forces.
"The bullet was apparently fired from a small caliber pistol that's not used by Iranian security forces," the Press TV anchor said.

TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- The woman whose death has come to symbolize Iranian resistance to the government's official election results did not die the way the opposition claims, government-backed Press TV said Sunday.
Neda, wearing a baseball cap over a black scarf, a black shirt, blue jeans and tennis shoes, does not appear to be chanting and seems to be observing the demonstration.
"Well, if the CIA wants to kill some people and attribute that to the government elements, then choosing women is an appropriate choice, because the death of a woman draws more sympathy," Ghadiri said.
After being stuck in traffic for more than an hour inside a Peugeot 206 -- a subcompact with a poorly working air conditioner -- Neda and the friend decided to get out of the car for some fresh air, a friend of Neda's told CNN after her death.

Transport for London (TfL) decided that posters of Joshua Harmon's acclaimed production, Bad Jews, contravened its policy following an investigation by an advertising regulator.
One complaint was made to the the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) during the play's first campaign, but the regulator concluded that the poster did not breach rules.
'It was subsequently submitted for display again and has been rejected as it contravened our advertising policy, which states that adverts will not be approved if they may cause widespread or serious offence.'
Producer Danny Moar has blasted TfL's decision, saying it seemed like 'censorship', despite the play winning a five-star review for the Jewish Chronicle.

A decomposed body found in a West London park on Saturday is that of Arnis Zalkalns - the prime suspect in the Alice Gross murder investigation, Scotland Yard said today.
A post-mortem examination of the body found in Boston Manor Park has been held and it has been formally identified as 41-year-old Zalkalns of Ealing, west London.
The grim discovery in a part of the park used for shelter by Eastern Europeans for years ended the Europe-wide manhunt for the convicted murderer, who is the only suspect in the death of 14-year-old Alice.
Scotland Yard said the cause of death is consistent with hanging and there is no evidence of any third party involvement.

The badly decomposed body of Arnis Zalkalns, 41, was found hanged in a dense copse of trees that he is believed to have once called home.
On the weekend, Zalkalns' girlfriend, Katerina Laiblova, 39, complained that police took nine days to investigate after she reported him missing.
He said: 'These searches expanded south and west from Trumpers Way for a further eight square kilometres, including Boston Manor Park and Osterley Park.
'These initial visual searches of open land highlighted inaccessible areas that required further search with specialist equipment, trained officers, police divers or search dogs.
Police said the corpse was 'badly decomposed', raising the prospect that it has been there since he went missing a week after Alice vanished.
There was a 'substantial' amount of forestry which had to be removed to allow forensic teams to get to the scene, a spokesman for Scotland Yard said.
It was found in parkland which is a popular haunt for Eastern European immigrant rough sleepers.
Those who knew the Latvian think he may have stayed in the park, and it remained one of his favourite places.
Shopkeeper Fereydoon Alavi, who is in his 50s, said the unknown teenager went into the Corner Shop and tried to buy alcohol before being accompanied by Zalkalns.
His former landlord Radoslav Andric, 64, said: 'He was a loner, he used to ride his bike around the park a lot.
The park runs alongside the Grand Union Canal, a mile from where Alice was last captured on CCTV.
Locals described an isolated part where immigrants erect shelters as a 'no go' area.

But most of this curiosity is stoked by fear and ignorance about what Ferguson, Missouri, is actually like.
If you know the real Ferguson, you already know why the riots happened, and you can predict what will happen once the grand jury makes its decision.
A little background: I went to elementary school about 40 minutes south of Ferguson, in the St.
Unfortunately the image you get of Ferguson is perfectly encapsulated by this opening I saw from a national television reporter commenting on the fact that the median income is "only" about $37,000 and apartments rent for as little as $450 a month.
Far from it, most national reporting would lead you to believe Ferguson, and especially the Third Ward where Michael Brown was killed, is like the set of "The Wire" when it's really a lot more like "Black-ish."

Ask anybody in the suburbs of Cleveland, Indianapolis or Omaha, Nebraska, or any other part of "flyover county." You can get a two bedroom apartment across the street from Starbucks for $450 a month just north of St.

The group urged all aid groups to co-ordinate their relief actions with the committee for access and assistance.

(CNN) -- Virginia Tech plans to consider all its options after it reviews a jury verdict that found it was negligent in a 2007 shooting rampage that left 33 people dead, including the gunman, a university spokesman said.
The move follows Wednesday's verdict by a seven-member jury in Christiansburg, Virginia, that awarded $4 million each to two victims' families who sued the state for wrongful death in the shooting massacre.
The jury found Virginia Tech failed to notify students early enough following the discovery of two shooting victims at West Ambler Johnston dormitory.

The move follows Wednesday's verdict by a seven-member jury in Christiansburg, Virginia, that awarded $4 million each to two victims' families who sued the state for wrongful death in the shooting massacre.
The Department of Education found, in a 2010 report, that Virginia Tech did not notify students in a "timely manner" -- as dictated by what is known as the Clery Act -- after the shooting at the dormitory.
The families of Erin Peterson and Julia Pryde, who were killed in Norris Hall, argued that had officials notified students, faculty and staff earlier of the shooting at the dormitory, lives might have been spared.
Since the massacre, the school has beefed up its communications, using methods that include e-mail notices; telephone, cellular phone and text messages; classroom electronic message signs; posters; university website notices; campus loudspeakers and desktop alerts.

Speculators are offering 'no-win, no-fee' deals as they try to exploit a planning loophole to win permission to build houses on open fields.
A Daily Mail investigation has revealed that Gladman Developments, a 'strategic land promoter', offers them the chance to increase the value of their land by a multiple of 50 or 60 by transforming agricultural land into development sites.
Gladman – one of the most successful of these 'predatory developers' – is pursuing 102 planning applications for huge housing developments all over England, most of them on greenfield land on the edge of rural towns and villages.
Country Life said in an article last week that villages have been 'stripped of their natural defences' by the Government's reforms, which have opened the floodgates to greenfield planning applications.
The Government is desperate to build more than 200,000 homes each year to meet booming demand.
Gladman Developments, which has a turnover of £200million a year, targets councils that cannot demonstrate a five-year housing supply.
David Gladman, director of Gladman Developments, insisted his company focused on 'sensible, sustainable locations'.

Ray Harford’s resignation at Blackburn, less than a month after ‘the Professor’ got his feet under the desk at Arsenal, was the first, with five more coming in the 1996-97 season.
Peter Reid’s dismissal from Leeds United in November 2003 marked the 50th reign Wenger had survived, while Steve Bruce’s decision to leave Wigan for Sunderland brought up the century in the summer of 2009.
In an era where Premier League chairmen are as forgiving to their managers as Jose Mourinho tends to be towards referees, Wenger is approaching two decades in the job – almost 15 years longer than the next longest-serving manager in the division.
Gerry Francis, Jacques Santini, Christian Gross, George Graham, Glenn Hoddle, Martin Jol, Juande Ramos, Harry Redknapp, Andre Villas-Boas and Tim Sherwood have all left since Wenger arrived.
Of the top flight’s ever-presents, Manchester United have unsurprisingly had the fewest changes, with just Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement and David Moyes’ sacking, while Liverpool have said goodbye to six bosses during Wenger’s tenure.

Vesta's geologic timescale is determined by the sequence of large impact events, primarily by the Veneneia and Rheasilvia impacts in Vesta's early history and the Marcia impact in its late history.
'This mapping was crucial for getting a better understanding of Vesta's geological history, as well as providing context for the compositional information that we received from other instruments on the spacecraft: the visible and infrared (VIR) mapping spectrometer and the gamma-ray and neutron detector (GRaND),' said Carol Raymond, Dawn's deputy principal investigator at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.
Applying the models to Vesta, Williams' team concluded that the oldest surviving crust on Vesta predates the Veneneia impact, which has an age of 2.1 billion years (asteroid system) or 3.7 billion years (lunar system).

Following the video's release acting president Oleksandr Turchynov warned: 'The Russian citizen Igor "Bes" Bezler is a criminal and murderer, that is why he should be punished under the Ukrainian and international law.

(CNN) -- Jillian Michaels just returned to "The Biggest Loser" in 2013, but she's already exiting the series once again.
Many have wondered whether Michaels is leaving because of the controversy with the most recent "Biggest Loser" winner, 24-year-old Rachel Frederickson, whose 155-pound weight loss left Michaels and her celebrity trainer co-star, Bob Harper, visibly shocked during the final reveal.
But Michaels points to another issue she had: the way the show chose to portray her character.
The impact of her TV persona was starting to affect her family, and Michaels felt at the end of Frederickson's season, she needed to "take a hard look at my work," she told the magazine.
So when "The Biggest Loser" returns on September 11, it'll be down one tough-loving trainer but will have added two new faces: NBC has announced that Jessie Pavelka and Jennifer Widerstrom will be the fitness buffs joining Harper and another returning trainer, Dolvett Quince.

A young woman who witnessed three Muslim women being threatened on a Melbourne train claimed police were reluctant to investigate the incident and only took it seriously when she vented her anger on Twitter.
Melbourne Law student Dana Affleck was on a Melbourne train when she witnessed three elderly Muslim women being threatened and verbally abused by what appeared to be a Australian 'anglo' man.

President Obama today defended his administration’s slow response to reports of chemical weapon use in Syria, in spite of his earlier promises that the use of such weapons would be considered ‘crossing a red line’.
He said the war-torn country is ‘a blemish on the international community.’
Pausing: President Obama said that there are a 'host of options' for how the U.S.
Photos and videos of civilians were released online last week that reportedly showed victims of chemical weapons attacks in Aleppo.
The talk covered a wide range of issues, including his approval of the FBI’s work both leading up to and in response to the Boston Marathon bombings, his continued disapproval of Guantanamo Bay prison camp, and the sequester.
He said that Russian intelligence forces have been cooperating fully with the investigation, though the relationship between the two countries is still frosty, as a residual side effect of the Cold War.
President Obama also said that another factor hurting our ability to fight terrorism is the continued usage of the Guantanamo Bay prison camp, where prisoners are currently holding a hunger strike to show their disgust with their treatment.
'Given the importance of sports in our society, for an individual who's excelled at the highest levels in one of major sports go ahead and say, this is who I am, I'm proud of it, I'm still a great competitor, I'm still seven feet tall and can bang with Shaq and, you know, deliver a hard foul -- and for, you know, a lot of young people out there who, you know, are -- are -- are, you know, gay or lesbian, who are struggling with these issues, to see a role model like that who's unafraid, I think it's a great thing.'

The press conference was the first that the President held since the White House Correspondents’ Dinner on Saturday night, where funny speeches were used to show a lighter relationship between the White House and the press.
The weekend revelry evaporated during one tense moment when reporter Jonathan Karl asked the President if he had enough ‘juice’ to get through the rest of his term, even though a number of his initiatives- including the gun control bill- have been overturned in the first 100 days of his second term.
President Obama today defended his administration’s slow response to reports of chemical weapon use in Syria, in spite of his earlier promises that the use of such weapons would be considered ‘crossing a red line’.
He said that his military teams have been compiling ‘a spectrum of options’ in terms of possible American use of force in the region since ‘as early as last year’ but they are still evaluating their plan.
President Obama also said that another factor hurting our ability to fight terrorism is the continued usage of the Guantanamo Bay prison camp, where prisoners are currently holding a hunger strike to show their disgust with their treatment.
He defended the work of the FBI, even though they have been subject to criticism following the revelation that both the FBI and the CIA had the elder suspect, Tamerlan Tsarnaev on terrorist watchlists but he was allowed to re-enter the country following six months abroad where it is believed that he may have become more radicalized.

She suffered depression and anxiety in her early teenage years before finally opening up about the ordeal to her to boyfriend, Anthony, at the age of 15, six months into their relationship.
Frederick Roskell, then 56, of Blackburn, Lancashire, appeared at Preston Crown Court charged with six counts of sexual assault of a child under the age of 13, and rape of a child under 13 – Miss Leyland.
She says she was terrified of riding on the school bus for the rest of her time in education and would always opt to walk home to avoid the trauma of reliving the devastating childhood episode.
Ms Leyland, of Preston, Lancashire, said she finally built up the courage to report paedophile Roskell after having a child of her own - and deciding she needed to act to prevent other youngsters from being targeted by him.
Miss Leyland's mother told her to report Roskell to the police but she refused saying she was still 'too scared to speak up, petrified that people wouldn't believe me and would label me a liar'.
Pointing at his own parents' graves, Roskell told the young girl: 'That's my mum and dad and if you tell anyone what I did I'll bury you next to them.'

Like their dad, who left a note for President Barack Obama, Jenna and Barbara Bush wrote Tuesday to Obama's daughters about what to expect in the weeks and months ahead.
The rest of the letter was more lighthearted, with the twins sharing some of their favorite memories of living in the White House, including playing house and hide-and-seek in what many children would consider to be the ultimate playground.
"In fact, go to anything and everything you possibly can: the Kennedy Center for theater, state dinners, Christmas parties (the White House staff party is our favorite!), museum openings, arrival ceremonies, and walks around the monuments."

Jerusalem (CNN)  -- Researchers said Wednesday for the first time they have found what they believe to be pieces of a burial shroud from the time of Jesus.
The find is of importance because tests on the shroud and the body it wrapped revealed the earliest proven case of leprosy in the Old City of Jerusalem.
And in addition, the weave of the shroud raises fresh doubts about the Shroud of Turin, which many people believe was used to wrap the body of Jesus.
"This is the first time that we have a shroud from the time of Jesus," said Shimon Gibson, the excavation director.
Researchers said they were surprised to find that the shrouded man suffered from both leprosy and tuberculosis.

It is likely the shrouded man died from tuberculosis , Spigelman said , and its presence in other remains found at the site suggest &quot; the significant impact social diseases such as tuberculosis had on society from the low socioeconomic groups up to the more affluent families , such as Tomb the Shroud in first-century Jerusalem . &quot;

It is likely the shrouded man died from tuberculosis, Spigelman said, and its presence in other remains found at the site suggest "the significant impact social diseases such as tuberculosis had on society from the low socioeconomic groups up to the more affluent families, such as Tomb the Shroud in first-century Jerusalem."
According to researchers involved in the excavation and subsequent testing, the recently discovered shroud lends more credible evidence that the Shroud of Turin does not date to Roman times when Jesus died but from a later period.
The origin of the Shroud of Turin, a burial cloth that some believe bears the image of Jesus, is a source of great controversy, with many academics arguing it dates from the Middle Ages and not the time of Jesus.
The discovery of leprosy was found in DNA samples taken from the skeletal remains and is the earliest proven case of the disease, according to Hebrew University professor Mark Spigelman.

inspectors are investigating a possible leak at the Hanford nuclear site after an elevated contamination reading was found in a leak detection pit, Washington Gov.
The elevated reading, however, doesn't pose an immediate public health threat, Inslee said.
The leak detection pit is located outside and adjacent to a double-shell tank identified as AY-102, the governor said.
The Hanford site, which once produced plutonium for atomic weapons, borders the Columbia River.
"Given the relatively early detection of this potential leak, the river is not at immediate risk of contamination should it be determined that a leak has occurred outside the tank," Inslee said.

Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Four Chinese fishermen died and 12 were missing in stormy waters off South Korea's Jeju Island on Tuesday as Typhoon Bolaven brought howling winds and torrential rain to the Korean Peninsula.
Maritime police on Jeju Island, situated off the southern tip of the South Korean mainland, said that 17 people had been rescued but that searches were on for those still unaccounted for after two boats capsized early Tuesday as Bolaven raged.
The powerful storm was moving north alongside the west coast of South Korea by Tuesday afternoon, disrupting transport, cutting off power and damaging property.
Nearly 200,000 households were without power, the disaster agency said, most of them in the south of the country.
The storm prompted the cancellation of 119 flights, the suspension of 96 ferry routes and the temporary closure of 21 roads, according to the agency.
President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea had called Monday on government agencies to take measures to minimize damage from the approaching storm, the national news agency Yonhap reported, citing Park Jeong-ha, a spokesman for Lee.

Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Four Chinese fishermen died and 12 were missing in stormy waters off South Korea's Jeju Island on Tuesday as Typhoon Bolaven brought howling winds and torrential rain to the Korean Peninsula.
The damage was also limited because Bolaven didn't bring winds as powerful as initially feared, said Morichiyo Ohshiro, an official from the Okinawa Prefecture Disaster Prevention and Crisis Management Division.
Okinawa, meanwhile, emerged relatively unscathed Monday after the typhoon buffeted it with maximum sustained winds near its center of 185 kilometers per hour (115 mph), according to the Hong Kong Observatory, which monitors storms in the region.
"As Typhoon Bolaven moves northward towards the Yellow Sea, it will drag Tembin toward the China coast very near Shanghai," said CNN International meteorologist Tom Sater.

-----------------------
Second Model with 0 correct:
The Colorado Springs campus does not have as many available housing units and so those students wishing to keep their guns with them ‘must have permission from their roommate,’ Tom Hutton, a spokesman for the campus, said.
The announcement comes less than a month after James Holmes, a former CU graduate student, allegedly shot dead 12 people at a movie theatre in Aurora, Colorado.
To obtain a concealed carry permit in Colorado, a person must be at least 21 years of age, complete an FBI background check, and have either previous military or police experience or proof of completion of a firearms training course.

Same-sex marriage: Same-sex marriage is allowed in 19 states and the District of Columbia
It seems like a hollow victory for those who wanted marriage equality for everyone, but now can't find a way around legal snarls that prevent them getting a divorce.
Texas doesn't recognize the marriage of Long and Powell, and a judge there ruled recently he had no jurisdiction to either void the union or formally grant a divorce.
Same-sex marriage is allowed in 19 states and the District of Columbia, but laws governing divorce have not kept pace, creating a contradictory patchwork that could take years to resolve.
It's difficult to calculate precisely how many same-sex couples have divorced, but watchdogs like Littrell are keeping a close eye on the way judges and state legislatures are responding to wedlock and other divorce-related problems.
'You can't get out of it unless you move here to New York and you meet the residency requirements.
Divorce proceedings are generally inconsistent from state to state, but the process has become more streamlined for same-sex couples who travel to a marriage recognition state to tie the knot.
If they're seeking an uncontested divorce, California, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Minnesota and Vermont — along with the District of Columbia — have loosened residency requirements.

After last week's North Korean attack on a South Korean island, the most important is to send a message to Pyongyang that Washington and Seoul have the capability -- and the will -- to respond with devastating force to any further acts of aggression.
A second is to strengthen the U.S.-ROK (Republic of Korea) joint capability to coordinate such a response, as well as to reinforce their anti-submarine capabilities that were so obviously inadequate last March, when North Korea torpedoed a South Korean naval vessel on the high seas.
This time, Washington and Seoul seem determined not only to demonstrate the resolve to strike back (albeit proportionately) if necessary, but to strengthen existing UN-sponsored sanctions against the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) that will effectively curtail the North's illicit activities as well as squeeze individuals in the elite structure.
Another dimension of the current exercises, which include the aircraft carrier George Washington and its strike group, is to demonstrate to China that, its strident objections to naval operations in the Yellow Sea notwithstanding, the United States not only has the right to operate in international waters but will do so in defense of its national interests.
Thus, the American message to Beijing is: "If you cannot help bring North Korea to cease its provocative behavior, we will be forced to take actions that, while not aimed at you, will discomfit you." If this leads China to more seriously strive to rein North Korea in, all the better.

The call for "civilized" conduct comes in the wake of a firestorm of anger and outrage unleashed in Egypt, China and around the world this week when a 15-year-old Chinese tourist carved his name in Chinese characters into the 3,500-year-old stone at Egypt's Luxor Temple.
The netizen reaction shows the incident in Egypt should not be used to generalize the behavior of Chinese travelers, says Mei Zhang, founder and CEO of travel agency WildChina, which handles both inbound and outbound tourists.
The government regulations also call on travelers to follow public orders, protect ecology, public infrastructure and utilities, maintain a clean environment, respect the rights of others and show them courtesy, Xinhua reported.

The listeria outbreak is the deadliest food-borne illness outbreak in the United States since 1998.
Cantaloupes from Jensen Farms should be disposed of immediately, even if some of them have been partially eaten, the agency recommended.

(CNN) -- The number of deaths linked to cantaloupes contaminated with the Listeria monocytogenes bacteria has risen to 28, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday.
The grower, Jensen Farms of Granada, Colorado, issued a voluntary recall of its Rocky Ford brand cantaloupes on September 14.
Unsanitary conditions at the Colorado cantaloupe farm's packing facility are a possible contributing cause of one of the nation's worst outbreaks of listeria contamination in food, health officials have said.
Refrigerating a cantaloupe will not kill the bacteria, which can grow at low temperatures, and consumers should not try to wash off the bacteria.

The draft agreement is between Kinetic Sports Association, a Swiss company that Adamu planned to create, and a 'private institution' in Qatar.
In December 2010, Qatar was surprisingly named as the host for the finals, despite their national team's poor record in international football and concerns that matches would be played in temperatures approaching 50C.

Now, however, law enforcers in two American states are using crime-prediction software to predict which freed prisoners are most likely to commit murder, and supervising them accordingly.
Instead of relying on parole officers to decide how much supervision inmates will need on the outside by looking at their records, the new system uses a computer algorithm to decide for them.
It has been developed by Professor Richard Berk, a criminologist at the University of Pennsylvania, who believes it will reduce the murder rate and those of other crimes.
He told ABC News that currently parole officers are using their own judgment to decide what level of supervision each parolee should have, based on their criminal record.

Ahmed Maher, a founder of the April 6 Youth Movement, which played a prominent role in last year's Tahrir Square uprising, called the ruling "provocative."
The court dissolved parliament after it had been in session for a little more that four months, saying that constitutional articles that regulated the parliamentary elections were invalid.
Many view the move as a "soft coup" staged by Egypt's powerful military, a move intended to diminish the power of the Islamists, who have long been held under the military's microscope.
The court ruling was "a complete coup d'etat through which the military council is writing off the most noble stage in the nation's history," said Mohamed el-Beltagy, a senior member of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party.
In the absence of a parliament, the winner of the runoff vote will be put in a position of dealing directly with Egypt's military leaders, a reason for SCAF to postpone the elections, said Mohamed ElBaradei, a 2005 Nobel Peace Prize laureate whose own presidential bid failed.

(CNN) -- The number of unexplained dolphin deaths on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, rose Friday, with rescuers tallying the toll at 103.
About 160 common dolphins have been found since the animals began stranding themselves in early January, said Michael Booth, a spokesman for the International Fund for Animal Welfare, the organization leading the rescue the effort.
The beachings have puzzled investigators, as rescue team members struggle to treat, tag and transport the living dolphins to the outer Cape Cod coast to be released.
While dolphin strandings are not uncommon on the cape, Katie Moore, a marine manager for the group, said earlier this week the event is extraordinary in its "protracted" nature as well as the number of dolphins involved.
Necropsies had been performed on at least nine of the dolphins, and blood and microbial swab samples have been taken from some that were found alive, Moore said.

Although the winter and early spring are the normal time of year for dolphin strandings to occur, the weather this season has been unusually warm, leading to speculation about climate change and subsequently low "distribution of prey" as possible causes.
Wellfleet harbormaster Michael Flanagan had earlier explained that usually, in the winter, "the harbor ices over and inhibits the animals from coming close to the shore.

Serial attention-seeker Andrew Davies, 51, was given the anti-social behaviour order after he took to lying in the road and feigning injuries in order to dupe passing motorists into calling him an ambulance.
Incredibly, the order bans Davies from deliberately falling over and lying on the ground anywhere in England or Wales, if he is doing it to for attention.
A court heard how he began pestering emergency services with prank calls but later went to increasingly bizarre lengths to get his kicks, as neighbours and ambulance crews became familiar with his antics and tried to ignore him.
After being persuaded by police to give up his mobile phone, Davies decided to attract attention instead by wandering the streets near his home in Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire, before pretending to fall over and acting as though he had been injured.
Davies was handed the two-year ASBO, which also prohibits him from being drunk in a public place and calling the emergency services unless in a genuine emergency, by magistrates in High Wycombe.

Alan Pardew vows to pick a strong team to face Tottenham in the Capital One Cup quarters on Wednesday
Indeed, before this campaign Pardew had never made it beyond the fourth round of either competition, a failure he conceded was ‘embarrassing’.
On Wednesday night, they face Spurs at White Hart Lane in the Capital One Cup quarter-final with debate on Tyneside raging over which match – this or Sunday’s Tyne-Wear derby – takes precedence.
That the majority of supporters have sided with the chance of a first Wembley appearance since 2000 and first piece of domestic silverware since the FA Cup in 1955 and their first trophy since the 1969 Inter-City Fairs Cup, serves to highlight the significance of the trip to north London.

Mr Freeman represented the Manchester United striker after he was caught doing 82 in a 50mph zone.
There, Welbeck, 21, escaped a ban and was ordered to pay a fine of just £65 for the offence in the Northenden area of Manchester last November.
However the standard fine is £60, so Mr Freeman went back into court where the district judge admitted his error and reduced the penalty.
Mr Freeman told Manchester Magistrates’ Court that a recording taken by the officer’s car proved Welbeck was not told what he was being offered.
District Judge Jonathan Taaffe accepted his argument, fined Welbeck £65 and issued three points - almost the same penalty that was originally offered (with a £60 fine).
He then reduced the fine to £60 following Mr Freeman’s intervention, but Welbeck was also ordered to pay costs totalling £365.
Welbeck, from Hale, Greater Manchester, is set to play tonight as England open their World Cup 2014 qualifying campaign in Chisinau, Moldova.

apparently was still yet to deliver a gift card Mustaine bought at a Salt Lake City, Utah shop nine days after he purchased it
I Guarantee It: Mustaine ironically quotes Men's Warehouse's slogan in his Internet diatribe concerning the chain's failure to live up to a two-day delivery policy
Singer Dave Mustaine took to Facebook to lambast the suit chain for failing to make good on its promise of a two-day delivery.
Mustaine wrote: ‘I really think that it sucks when people make false claims, that they don't care to make good on a problem that is clearly their fault, and with all of the 'ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE IT' crap I just had to say something.'
Mustaine bought the gift card at a Men’s Wearhouse in Salt Lake City, Utah, before Christmas as a gift for his tour manager Jim Carroccio, but nine days later it still had not turned up in the post.

Vinas is a young American who was arrested in Pakistan late in 2008 after allegedly training with al Qaeda in the Afghan-Pakistan border area.
Vinas's and Othmani's account of their time in al Qaeda training camps in Pakistan is a playbook of how the terror group survived after 9/11 and continues to operate in the remote hills of Pakistan.
strikes using Predator drones have degraded al Qaeda's capabilities since the end of last year, the accounts suggest that al Qaeda has been able to sustain many of its training operations by confining them to small dwellings in the remote mountains of Waziristan.
But the decentralization of al Qaeda's training and their ever closer ties with local Pakistani Taliban, mean it remains extremely difficult to eliminate from the mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Above all the accounts from Vinas and others show that al Qaeda's training structures have but one goal, another 9/11.

‘The reason is because if the economy is still weak then, living standards are still falling, if youth unemployment is still high and if there’s still a case on our long-term infrastructure to get things moving with interest rates low, of course there’s a case for doing that.
Economic Secretary to the Treasury Sajid Javid said: ‘Ed Miliband’s spending “discipline” has barely lasted five minutes as Ed Balls admits Labour would still spend more and borrow more.

San Diego, California (CNN) -- Don't be surprised if, any day now, you read that the People's Republic of Arizona is in the market for nuclear warheads to put an end, once and for all, to illegal immigration on its southern border.
In a letter to President Obama, Brewer asked that the National Guard reallocate reconnaissance helicopters and robotic surveillance craft to the "border states" to prevent illegal immigration.
There's the hypocritical war against the very illegal immigrants that the state has spent the past 15 years providing with gainful employment by allowing them to do jobs that Arizonans wouldn't do.
It is dishonest because it's not true.
So I can tell you what the border patrol agents on the ground would tell you: The U.S.-Mexico border has never been more fortified.
He is reportedly ready to announce that he is sending 1,200 National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to help control illegal immigration and quell some of the violence.

-----------------------
Second Model with 0 correct:
Bush launched Operation Jumpstart -- that they're unarmed and act only in a support capacity to the Border Patrol by fixing vehicles, monitoring surveillance equipment, repairing fences -- I think sending the National Guard is a fine idea.
Brewer just signed SB 1070, a disgraceful anti-immigration and pro-racial-profiling law, to give local and state cops throughout the state the chance to suit up and play border patrol agent.
In fact, it might not be a bad idea for Arizona officials to pipe down and stop bragging about how they're doing the job of the federal government in terms of immigration enforcement, since that's a no-no under the Constitution.
It involves fining, arresting and prosecuting the employers of illegal immigrants, including people who are, this election year, streaming into fundraisers for McCain, Brewer and other tough-talking Republicans vowing to solve a problem that many of their backers helped create.

These economic gains have been threatened by unprecedented violence between the Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM), the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), and the Awami National Party (ANP) -- all of whom are looking to benefit from the financial spoils.
Sharif might have support in the National Assembly for some of the more difficult reforms, such as taxation and cutting energy subsidies, but the backing of special interest groups, trade unions and provincial governments among others will not always be guaranteed.
Part of the problem is that the PML-N-led government in Punjab has not taken aggressive legal or police action against militant groups like Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Sipah-e-Sahaba, some of whom in recent months have been implicated for their involvement in major attacks outside of Punjab.

The Obama-Clinton battle then hinged on who could sway more superdelegates -- the party leaders who could decide the winner if the primary voters could not -- and few superdelegates had the stature of Ted Kennedy.
Fundraising: Flush with cash from a nationwide network of small and large contributors, Obama announced in June he would opt out of public financing -- the first presidential candidate to pay for his campaign with donations rather than government money since the system began in 1976.
Winning Iowa: Obama's victory in the Iowa caucuses knocked almost all of his Democratic competitors out in the first nominating contest, and it pushed the "inevitable" Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, back on her heels.

There is often a negative stigma attached with being a female who chooses to live alone, especially in Sydney's affluent Eastern suburbs.
But while female solo-dwellers are being labelled as sad, lonely and socially isolated, a new study has shown that of these women, the majority have university degrees, reputable careers and healthy social lives.
The study conducted by the Australian Institute of Family Studies shows that a quarter of Australians have opted for solo living and 70 percent of the women are more likely to have a university degree than the men.
This means that the women who live alone in the Eastern suburbs are fast becoming more successful than their male counterparts.

Two poets are introduced to the platform weekly and each poet profile features a short biography, two text poems, a photograph and audio podcast recordings of the wordsmith reading their works.

London (CNN) -- The death of a 14-year-old girl who was apparently fatally savaged by a pack of dogs at a friend's home has prompted horror in Britain.
She was found dead at a house in Atherton, near Wigan in northwest England, on Tuesday afternoon after police were called about reports of an unconscious girl and "out-of-control" dogs.
Armed officers were confronted by a pack of dogs, described as "aggressive." Four were killed, and a fifth, which was shut up elsewhere in the house, was contained.
UK newspaper reports suggest that an American bulldog, two Staffordshire bull terriers and a bull mastiff attacked the teenager.

"Singling out a particular breed or type of dog has repeatedly been proven to be ineffective at curbing dog bites because breed alone is not predictive of whether a dog may pose a danger," its website says.

A lethal combination of worn aircraft parts and unprecedented speed caused last year's Reno Air Races crash, which killed a veteran pilot and 10 spectators, and injured more than 60 others, federal accident investigators concluded Monday.
Among the improvements: race planes will be required to demonstrate their airworthiness at racing speeds before participating in races, spectators will be seated further from the aerial race course and the Reno Air Races has "flattened" the tight turn where last year's accident occurred.
"Pilots know that they are taking risks, but air race pilots expect that the risks taken are theirs alone," said NTSB Chairman Deborah A.P.
"The spectators assumed that their safety had been assessed and addressed."
Since the accident, several victims and family members have filed suit, one alleging that the crash was not a "freak accident," but was "the predictable result of a reckless drive for speed by a risk taking pilot and crew, coupled with an insatiable drive for profit" by race organizers.

Rather than end the strike after 24 hours, as the unions have previously done, this time they promised to vote every day on whether to continue.
Rail workers have also said they will stay off the job Wednesday, and air transport workers are voting Tuesday night on whether to continue industrial action, a transport union spokesman told CNN.

The presence of Russian troops in Crimea has sent alarm bells ringing in Western capitals, with some people predicting that it is basically a prelude to a full-blown invasion of predominantly Russian speaking eastern parts of the country, with Russian tanks rolling in.
Very hard to see though how Western countries can exert serious economic pressure on Russia, considering the state of their economies and possible huge losses they will incur.
The thing about the crisis in Ukraine is that the West has greatly misjudged the way Russia would respond to the possibility of its neighbor sliding into chaos and anarchy, with the so-called interim unity government in Kiev failing to establish its authority in the east and south of the country.
So Putin has chosen to use the 25,000 Russian troops based at Sevastopol, reinforcing them with another 16,000 soldiers, to prevent clashes between radicals on all sides erupting and provide stability in Crimea where about 60% of the population are ethnic Russians.
But any suggestions that the Kremlin is actually ready to start a full-blown invasion of Ukraine are way, way off the mark.

Although politicians and their advertising gurus often speak to Black America as a collective, homogeneous group, the black population is anything but a monolith.
In the past decade, the more than 40 million strong black population in America has become increasingly diverse: economically, socially, technologically and even philosophically.
Though Barack Obama will be able to count on a massive percentage of the black vote on Election Day, the rest of the ticket will need to dig deeper than the canned speeches dealing with racial injustice of the past to satisfy today's black voters.

The Guardian/ICM poll of Westminster voting intentions put the SNP on 43 per cent in Scotland - nearly double its 2010 general election performance.
Alex Salmond stepped down as First Minister following the Scottish referendum, but will stand for the SNP in the Gordon constituency at next May’s election leading to the possibility of a comeback at Westminster.
Leading polling expert Professor John Curtice of Strathclyde University said: ‘There is no reason to believe that the swing to the SNP does not extend to what are supposedly the safest Labour seats in Scotland.
Mr Miliband was reportedly asked by former Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont (right): ‘Why are you here?
‘If we take into account the difference in the movement in different types of seats then the estimate becomes SNP 53, Labour three, and Liberal Democrat three - while the Conservatives emerge empty handed.

This makes me wonder how in the hell our political process became so distorted that Obama needs this much money to run for re-election.
And yet, at the end of March, Obama and his presumed general election opponent, Mitt Romney, had raised nearly a combined $300 million, almost enough to fund Planned Parenthood's annual budget by themselves.
Imagine how many families could be helped if just half of that was used to train people for the new job market, as opposed to being spent to help one guy get hired?
Face it, the president and Romney may have different political and economic views, but they are both propped up by highly affluent power brokers who are expecting big returns for the big checks they are writing.
We don't just need campaign reform, we need roadblocks to prevent special interest groups from turning the democratic process into more of a sham that it already is.
So, ideally Obama and Romney would both get $10 million and 40 hours of advertisement to state their case.

Face it, the president and Romney may have different political and economic views, but they are both propped up by highly affluent power brokers who are expecting big returns for the big checks they are writing.
This is why the worst thing to happen to our process was the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, which allows corporations (and unions) to spend unlimited funds to promote a candidate.

The fiscal pact was signed by most European leaders late last year , and Germany , the economic powerhouse of the region , has said it is not up for renegotiation .
-----------------------
Second Model with 0 correct:
The pact, championed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, is designed to increase fiscal discipline and prevent a future crisis by ensuring that governments respect deficit rules and do not overspend.
Holding its first Cabinet meeting Thursday, the government agreed to scrutinize public spending and review all Cabinet ministers' wages, spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem said.
The cut means the gross salary of the prime minister and president will drop from 21,300 euros to 14,910 euros ($18,970) a month, a government statement said.
Speaking earlier as he took over as finance minister from Francois Baroin, Moscovici said the government's focus would be on the Greek crisis, the consolidation of the eurozone and a reorientation of European efforts in favor of growth.

"We have no specific reason to think there is anything more to Larry's condition, but we find it odd that the company would already rule him out of the 2Q call, which is likely still a few weeks away," said Doug Anmuth, an analyst at JP Morgan.

While the balance of power between the United States and the rest of the hemisphere will be a certain talking point, Santos also laid out an agenda for Latin American countries to tackle among themselves.

Brain scans revealed neurons respond differently to real words compared to so-called 'nonsense' words in what's been dubbed 'visual dictionary'
The study, carried out at Georgetown University Medical Centre, suggests brain is 'holistically tuned' to recognise complete words, according to the researchers.
For the research the part of the brain associated with learning was examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), before and after participants learnt the new words.
The researchers said this shows the brain is 'holistically tuned' to recognise complete words, and may also provide insights into how to help people with reading disabilities.
For the research the part of the brain associated with learning was examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
From this, the team found the visual word form area changed as the participants learned the 'nonsense' words.
In particular, the team found the visual word form area in the fusiform gyrus (shown in purple) changed as the participants learned the 'nonsense' words.
The neurons began by responding to the training words as if they were nonsense, but over time, these neurons began to respond as though they were learning real words

It's fair to say Joseph Stalin, the notorious dictatorial leader of the Soviet Union, still holds a curiosity for many.
The Georgia native helped create much that is modern Sochi, the host of the 2014 Winter Games, when he built his summer retreat in this town in 1937.
The property walls are a secure 70 centimeters thick and, on Stalin's orders, the house has no heating.

In just over a week, three brutal shootings have left seven people -- including three young children -- dead, and two more fighting for their lives.

City authorities have canceled the annual carnival, which was to have taken place this week, both out of respect for the victims and their families, and because of concerns over safety.

Toulouse, a pretty city on the banks of the Garonne river in southwestern France, is best known for its historic old town, universities, churches and galleries, and for being home to aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
It seems unlikely that the city's residents will feel like celebrating anything until the killer is caught and brought to justice -- until then, Cohadon says, a mood of "worry and incomprehension" will continue to hang over the town.
Security has been beefed up across the city -- and at religious sites around the country -- and anti-terrorism police from Paris have been brought in to oversee the investigation, a sign that the killings are officially considered an act of terrorism, but the gunman remains at large.

The anonymous French forestry worker also said he saw a man on a motorbike in the lay-by near Lake Annecy where Saad al-Hilli, 50, his 47-year-old dentist wife Ikbal, and her elderly mother Suhaila al-Allaf were killed last September.
Iraqi-born Mr al-Hilli's eldest daughter Zainab was shot, beaten and left for dead - but survived.
Her four-year-old sister Zeena lay hidden under her mother's corpse and was only discovered eight hours after the murders.

Sufism is a branch of Islam that traces many of its principles from the prophet Muhammad through his cousin and son-in-law Ali ibn Abi Talib.
Sufis believe that they are practising ihsan (perfection of worship) as revealed by the Archangel Gabriel to Muhammad: ‘Worship and serve Allah as you are seeing Him and while you see Him not yet truly He sees you’.
Sufis practise mortification of the flesh as way of showing their devotion to their saints such as can be seen here: swords in eyeballs, pierced cheeks and skewers in their backs.

Let's not forget that Dortmund are a club accustomed to losing their best players annually and have seen the likes of Nuri Sahin, Shinji Kagawa, Mario Gotze and Robert Lewandowski leave in consecutive seasons.

Tel Aviv, Israel (CNN) -- Gil Shwed is an Israeli programmer and entrepreneur who is regarded as one of the fathers of modern Internet security.
He got his first job writing software at the age of 12, and by 1993, at the age of 24, he formed the Internet security company Check Point with two business partners and a borrowed computer in his associate's grandmother's apartment in Tel Aviv.
Check Point created the first firewall using "stateful inspection" -- the second-generation of firewall technology widely used today.
As a result, his company Check Point now has grown to boast nearly 3,000 staff and accounts for one third of the global security software market, with its security software used by every Fortune 100 company.
"I never imagined the Internet to have such a huge effect on the world or for Check Point to be a company that sells for nearly a billion-and-a-half dollars today," he said.
Shwed's company has a new product called ThreatCloud, which it bills as the first collaborative approach to fighting cybercrime.

A delivery of salt arrived in Jersey City on Monday -- an order placed two and a half weeks ago.
While coordinating with one of its main salt suppliers, Dee said, the New Jersey DOT learned of a 40,000-ton pile of salt in Maine that had not been spoken for.
The New Jersey DOT sent a smaller U.S.-flagged barge Monday night to bring about 9,500 tons of salt to New Jersey and expects it to arrive by Friday or Saturday, Dee said.
In 2011, Bergen County, New Jersey, officials used a mixture of salt and water that resembles pickle juice and costs significantly less than salt, former county Public Works Director Joe Crifasi told CNN affiliate WCBS.
Even before the last storm, more than 372,000 tons of salt had been used in New Jersey this winter, compared with "last year's 258,000 tons for the whole winter," Dee said.

The sky blue-clad national women's basketball team from war-ravaged Somalia has just beaten Qatar, the host nation, at the 2011 Arab Games, in a hotly-contested match that ended 67-57 to the East African country.
Notwithstanding Somalia's prolonged civil war and shattered sports infrastructure, the team says it had to prepare for the Games in the bullet-ridden police headquarters in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu.
In recent years, many Somali athletes have been threatened by members of the militant Islamist group Al Shabaab who see sport as an "un-Islamic" activity, according to Duran Ahmed Farah, the Somali National Olympic Committee (NOC) senior vice president for international relations.
In summer 2006, the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), which then controlled Mogadishu, labelled sport as a "satanic act" and issued an order prohibiting women from playing sport, including basketball.
Yet, despite the threats and all the setbacks, Somalia's national women's basketball team concluded its participation at the Games on Monday with the very respectable tally of three losses and two victories -- Kuwait also lost to Somalia.

‘MoD uniform acquisition has been focused on operational requirements in the last few years with combat garments and high profile parade and ceremonial uniforms understandably being the top priorities.
It is the latest move by the Ministry of Defence to ensure the military is ‘inclusive’ and does not discriminate against service personnel – but it runs the risk of charges of political correctness.
Pregnant troops in the Army are currently issued long-sleeved blouses, pregnancy trousers with an elasticated waist, an unstylish beige maternity dress and a cardigan.

In fact, in a lengthy decision, Judge Chin ruled against the makers of M&Ms, rejecting Mars, Inc.'s attempt to dismiss the Cowboy's lawsuit.
On the first page of his decision, the judge pasted photos of the litigating parties side by side and wrote,  "This is the case of The Naked Cowboy versus The Blue M&M."
Even Judge Chin recognized that The Naked Cowboy is no ordinary street entertainer.
Judge Chin then explained that "beginning in April 2007, Mars began running an animated cartoon advertisement on two oversized video billboards in Times Square, featuring a blue M&M dressed "exactly like The Naked Cowboy," wearing only a white cowboy hat, cowboy boots, and underpants, and carrying a guitar." And get this -- the video "played on a continuous loop every few minutes over a nine-month period."
Rather, Judge Chin thought it was a question for a jury to decide and wrote that the complaint "plausibly argues that consumers would believe that the M&M Cowboy characters were promoting a product rather than merely parodying The Naked Cowboy, and that viewers would believe that The Naked Cowboy had endorsed M&Ms."

At the end of his essay for POLITICO Magazine, Serpico offers a six-point solution, which he says includes police using better methods to find new police officers, offering 'examples-based training and simulations,' making sure cops understand their communities and are active in them, holding police accountable when they do something illegal, rewarding and recognizing honest police officers, and also making sure police are monitored externally.
They hadn’t even called for assistance—I never heard the famed "Code 1013," meaning "Officer Down." They didn’t call an ambulance either, I later learned; the old man did.

Were it not for injuries then he would have established himself as England’s best left back and, given Luke Shaw’s failure to impact at Old Trafford this season, Gibbs, at 25, could make the position his own should he maintain his fitness.
Rivalling him for our No 9 jersey are OIivier Giroud and Danny Welbeck, but a return of eight and seven goals respectively means Kane gets the pick, just as he should do when Roy Hodgson names his next England team.

Many assumed the blond hair of Melanesia was the result of gene flow — a trait passed on by European explorers, traders and others who visited in the preceding centuries.
The islanders themselves give several possible explanations for its presence - they generally chalked it up to sun exposure, or a diet rich in fish, say the researchers.
Around 5-10 per cent of the population of the Solomon Islands have blond hair - but it's due to an entirely different gene from Europeans

President Barack Obama will meet with more than a dozen tech company bosses Tuesday, one week after industry leaders asked the government to change its spying practices.
The White House meeting comes a day after a federal judge said the government's collection of domestic phone records is unconstitutional.
But he put off enforcing his order barring the government from collecting the information, pending an appeal by the government.
Leon also noted that the government "does not cite a single instance in which analysis of the NSA's bulk metadata collection actually stopped an imminent attack, or otherwise aided the government in achieving any objective that was time-sensitive in nature."
The Patriot Act that Congress passed after the 9/11 attacks broadened the government's ability to conduct anti-terrorism surveillance in the United States and abroad, eventually including the metadata collection.In order to collect the information, the government has to demonstrate that it's "relevant" to an international terrorism investigation.

Obama plans to sit down with Tim Cook of Apple and Eric Schmidt of Google, as well as executives from Twitter, Microsoft, Facebook, Salesforce, Netflix , Etsy, Dropbox, Yahoo!, Zynga, Sherpa Global, Comcast, LinkedIn and AT&T, a White House official said.
But the 1978 FISA law lays out exactly what the special court must decide: "A judge considering a petition to modify or set aside a nondisclosure order may grant such petition only if the judge finds that there is no reason to believe that disclosure may endanger the national security of the United States, interfere with a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation, interfere with diplomatic relations, or endanger the life or physical safety of any person."
Keith Alexander told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that "15 separate judges of the FISA Court have held on 35 occasions that Section 215 (of the Patriot Act) authorizes the collection of telephony metadata in bulk in support of counterterrorism investigations."
District Judge Richard Leon's ruling came as the Obama administration completes a review of NSA surveillance in the aftermath of the Snowden leaks.

Now, a new study  suggests that hunting did significantly deplete mammoth populations in Western Europe around 30,000 years ago.
By studying the bones of mammoths, horses and reindeer, the experts ruled out climate change and food shortages as the reason for the population plunge.
A new study suggests that hunting did significantly deplete mammoth populations in Western Europe around 30,000 years ago, adding weight to the argument that humans are to blame for the creature's extinction.
All but a few isolated island populations disappeared between 20,000 and 10,000 years ago.
All three species showed a mainly stable concentration of isotopes during the Gravettian era, meaning that their environment didn’t change much, ruling out climate change as the reason for the decline of mammoths.

A new study suggests that hunting did significantly deplete mammoth populations in Western Europe around 30,000 years ago, adding weight to the argument that humans are to blame for the creature's extinction.
The team analysed the composition of stable isotopes in mammoth, horse and reindeer bones – a technique that is used for gathering dietary and environmental information from extinct species.
By studying bones, researchers found that numbers of woolly mammoths declined, but that climate conditions as well as food and water supplies for the giant herbivores remained stable, indicating that hunting is the main cause.

Sitting on top of a volcanic pipe (a geologic tube formed by an ancient underground volcanic explosion), the park is the only diamond site in the world that is open to the public.
We've all heard of the man who bought a $4 painting at a garage sale, found an original copy of the Declaration of Independence inside, and sold it for $2.4 million.
So he went online and found that his painting was similar in style to the work of Martin Johnson Heade, an American still-life artist best known for landscapes and flower arrangements.
In 1999, The Museum of Fine Arts in Houston purchased the painting for $1.2 million dollars.

(CNN) -- Scientists have unearthed a giant virus more than 30,000 years old from the frozen soil in a remote region of Siberia.
While this ancient virus is harmless to people, the scientists behind the discovery warn that the discovery suggests that the thawing of permafrost in polar regions, as a result of either climate change or mining, could bring threats to human health.
The ancient virus, named Pithovirus sibericum, infects amoebas, not humans or animals.
It survived in the Siberian ice from a period when woolly mammoths and saber-tooth cats roamed the earth.
And the potentially bad news: the reemergence of other viruses "is no longer the domain of science fiction," the center said.

While this ancient virus is harmless to people, the scientists behind the discovery warn that the discovery suggests that the thawing of permafrost in polar regions, as a result of either climate change or mining, could bring threats to human health.
But Pithovirus is in turn comfortably eclipsed by a previously discovered giant virus, Pandoravirus, which contains roughly 2,500 genes.
The discovery of Pithovirus "shows how incomplete our understanding of microscopic biodiversity is when it comes to exploring new environments," France's National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) said.
"This is an indication that viruses pathogenic for human or animals might also be preserved in old permafrost layers, including some that have caused planet-wide epidemics in the past," said Jean-Michel Claverie, one of the study's co-authors.

Robyn Wardle, CEO for Family Planning NT, is calling for abortion pill RU486 to be made legal in the Northern Territory
An expert in family planning says the Northern Territory still have a 'cowboy mentality' because medical termination pill RU486 is still illegal in the state.
Robyn Wardle, CEO for Family Planning NT, wants the pill to be legalised in the region so women don't have to wait until they are at least seven weeks pregnant for a surgical procedure where they will be put under anaesthetic.
The NT is the only state in Australia that has not made the pills legal under the Medical Services Act.
Family Planning NT say they have been campaigning the government for 12 months and seen no movement in their agenda.

"This is for Americans, for American jobs, to build an American middle class, and it will create 40,000 immediate jobs," Landrieu said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote.
And as soon as the new Republican Congress is sworn in next year, Keystone will be back on the agenda, along with efforts to curtail Obamacare, raising the prospect of Obama issuing a series of vetoes.

As President Obama's senior staff discovered, gender stereotypes still encourage men to dominate and females to defer, perpetuating women's second-class status in the workforce.
The mystique of masculinity, for example, encourages many men to view studying hard as "a girl thing." It also leads many to seek work in the unstable, seasonal construction sector or in other "manly" jobs, many of which are concentrated in declining industries, rather than preparing themselves for "traditionally female" jobs in health care, child care, teaching, and social work."Manly" males bully other males who show interest in such work, accusing them of acting "gay" or being "girlie-men." And when men defy these stereotypes to seek such work, they often encounter gender discrimination from employers who believe that a man cannot be as good a nurturer or helper as a woman.
According to their report, when women "act assertively, focus on work tasks, display ambition," or engage in other behaviors that receive high praise when done by men, they are perceived as "too tough" and "unfeminine." But when women pay attention to work relationships and express "concern for other people's perspective," they are considered less competent than men.
A wise executive -- in a school, a business, or a nation -- must help his or her team learn to respect all styles of self-presentation and to listen to all views, as Obama evidently did when it was brought to his attention.

Hawthorn AFL coach Alastair Clarkson has been diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome after he was admitted to hospital on Monday night with acute back pain.
Symptoms include a tingly, numb sensation in the arms and legs which can result in a loss of feeling and movement.
Guillain-Barre syndrome (pronounced Ghee-lan Bar-ray) syndrome is a rare but serious condition of the nerves that control the body's senses and movements.
It causes the immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness) to attack these nerves, causing them to become inflamed.

Lucky escape: Jonah Murphy, one, from Hebburn, South Tyneside, fell nine feet through the bannisters just as he had learned to walk
A baby's first attempt at walking ended in disaster after he fell through a gap in the bannisters and onto hard tiles on the floor below.
Jonah Murphy, from Hebburn, South Tyneside, was playing in an upstairs bedroom when he decided to take his first steps unaided, two days before his first birthday.
The stairgate was closed but he stumbled on the landing and plunged straight through a gap in the bannisters, falling nine feet onto the hall floor below.
Jonah's parents heard the thud and called an ambulance, which took him to South Tyneside District Hospital where doctors diagnosed a fractured skull.
Now, nine days on from the fall, he is back at home with his parents Kelly, 33, and David Murphy, 39, and older brother, Flynn, five.
Mrs Murphy said: 'He's doing great now and he's back on his feet, but I really thought we were either going to lose him, or if he survived, he wouldn't be the same little boy he was before.

Andriy Yarmolenko lets fly with a stunning strike to give the hosts the lead on the night
Vitorino Antunes completed Dynamo's scoring with a beauty from the Portuguese defender to knock the stuffing out of Everton
They looked shaky from the first moment on a bare and bobbly pitch, with some players anonymous and others not up to the task.
Andrei Yarmolenko had made an impression on Everton’s players with his style and grace in the first leg and he opened the scoring with a quite brilliant goal, bending in a 25-yard drive that flashed past Tim Howard.
Everton roared back and had rattled the hosts with a brilliant effort from Romelu Lukaku, the Belgian scoring the 100th goal of his career with a bending left-footed effort from the edge of the area after seizing on a loose ball.
Half-time should have given Martinez a chance to unscramble the senses, to make changes and give Everton clarity but, for some reason, he chose not to make any substitutions and Dynamo simply re-emerged to pin them back on the ropes.
Dynamo made sure of a place in the last eight in the 56th minute when Oleg Gusev converted from close range but, again, there were more shambolic errors.

Abstractive Summary:
Trailing by a goal from the first leg, Yarmolenko soon wiped that out with a magical strike in the 21st minute
Lukaku levelled on the night soon after with his eighth in the competition
Teodorczyk and Veloso struck before the break to knock the wind out of Roberto Martinez's men

While housing costs and domestic bills make up the biggest slice of weekly outgoings, the Office for National Statistics said Britons are now more willing to make expensive purchases which they put off during the downturn.
The average weekly household expenditure last year was £517.30, up from £501 in 2012 in real terms.
‘However, the results have also seen an increase in expenditure on big ticket items, such as new cars in 2013, indicating that pent up demand is being realised.’
Despite families feeling the pinch, spending on recreation and culture has held up and actually increased between 2001-02 and 2013, from £53.80 (adjusted for inflation) to £63.90 on average per week.
Spending on package holidays abroad accounted for an average of £21.00 per week in 2013, in part as a result of the growing cruise market with number of people taking an ocean cruise continuing to grow by 1.5 per cent in 2013.

detailed to a Chicago newspaper her husband's "collapse" and his last two months getting treated for gastrointestinal and mental health issues, saying he's still "very depressed" though showing some progress.
Sandi Jackson, an alderwoman in Chicago, talked with the Chicago Sun-Times shortly after returning from visiting her husband at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, with their two children.
"What I can tell you is my husband has his good days and bad days, and they are increasing his depression medication to therapeutic levels," Sandi Jackson told the paper.
Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader, has not been on Capitol Hill since late May.
In early July, the congressman's office announced he was "receiving intensive medical treatment at a residential treatment facility for a mood disorder." Then, a few weeks later, his office issued another statement via the Mayo Clinic indicating that he was undergoing an "extensive inpatient evaluation for depression and gastrointestinal issues" at the prestigious medical facility.

Despite the austerity affecting ordinary people around the globe in the wake of the recession, the richest 85 billionaires saw their fortunes increase by a total of around £150 billion over the past year - the equivalent of £415 million a day or almost a third of a million pounds a minute, the report by development charity Oxfam found.
Research earlier this year found that these 85 people had access to wealth equal to that of half the world's population.
If the world's billionaires were taxed at a rate of just 1.5% on their wealth over 1 billion US dollars, it would raise £46 billion a year - enough to get every child into school and deliver health services in all of the world's poorest countries - said the report, entitled Even it Up: Time To End Extreme Inequality.
Oxfam's chief executive Mark Goldring said: 'Inequality is one of the defining problems of our age.
Oxfam challenged governments to follow a seven-point plan to rein in inequality, by clamping down on tax dodging; investing in universal free healthcare and education; introducing equal pay legislation; agreeing a global goal to tackle inequality; introducing minimum wages and moving towards a living wage for all workers; shifting the burden of taxation from labour and consumption towards capital and wealth; and providing adequate safety nets for the poor, including a minimum income guarantee.

His sister Sara said the internet giant had ‘blood on its hands’ because it had hosted exchanges between one of the soldier’s murderers and an Al Qaeda extremist, in which the former said: ‘Let’s kill a soldier.’
However, the social network’s staff failed to tell MI5 about the ‘graphic and emotive’ posts from Michael Adebowale, made just six months before the atrocity took place.
But civil liberties campaigners fear Drummer Rigby's appalling murder is being used as 'an excuse to justify the further surveillance and monitoring of the entire UK population'.
And former MI6 director Richard Barratt said today it would be 'almost impossible' and 'unfair' for businesses like Facebook to hand over  terror related activity to the security services.
Barrett added it was 'almost impossible' because of 'legalities' and because there are 125million posts a day on Facebook passing on terror-related posts would be an 'enormous job'.
Fusilier Rigby’s sister, Sara McClure, 25, said: ‘Facebook have my brother’s blood on their hands.
I hold them partly responsible for Lee’s murder.
Facebook hosted exchanges between Adebowale and an Al Qaeda extremist, in which the former said: ‘Let’s kill a soldier’
Response: Former MI6 director Richard Barratt said it would be 'almost impossible' and 'unfair' for  Facebook to hand over terror related activity but David Cameron claims: ‘It is their social responsibility to act on this'
‘We have lost a son but we have never been able to mourn Lee.
The ISC criticised both MI5 and MI6 for a string of blunders when tracking Fusilier Rigby’s killers, Adebowale and Michael Adebolajo – but, controversially, it insisted that given what the agencies knew at the time, they could not be blamed for failing to prevent the murder.
Executive director Jim Killock, of the Open Rights Group, said: 'To pass the blame to internet companies is to use Fusilier Rigby’s murder to make cheap political points.
'The committee should not use the appalling murder of Fusilier Rigby as an excuse to justify the further surveillance and monitoring of the entire UK population,' he said.
A senior internet industry source told the Independent there has been a 'coordinated' attempt by the security services 'to attack US-based technology companies in particular'.

Second Model with 5 correct:
The family of Lee Rigby today accused Facebook of failing to help stop his killers as it emerged the social network has still not handed over data from five accounts opened by one of his extremist murderers.
His sister Sara said the internet giant had ‘blood on its hands’ because it had hosted exchanges between one of the soldier’s murderers and an Al Qaeda extremist, in which the former said: ‘Let’s kill a soldier.’
However, the social network’s staff failed to tell MI5 about the ‘graphic and emotive’ posts from Michael Adebowale, made just six months before the atrocity took place.
Having not seen the content of the other five accounts, GCHQ cannot be certain that there is no evidence of attack planning in the rest of these accounts'.
But civil liberties campaigners fear Drummer Rigby's appalling murder is being used as 'an excuse to justify the further surveillance and monitoring of the entire UK population'.
Former home secretary Jack Straw said there was a ‘cultural problem amongst the leadership of some of these [sites] who have got a distorted libertarian ideology, who believe that somehow this allows them to be wholly detached from responsibility’.
Miss McClure told The Sun newspaper: ‘It is totally clear from this report that information so vital could have alerted our security services to this terror plot.’
The ISC criticised both MI5 and MI6 for a string of blunders when tracking Fusilier Rigby’s killers, Adebowale and Michael Adebolajo – but, controversially, it insisted that given what the agencies knew at the time, they could not be blamed for failing to prevent the murder.
Announcing £130million in funding to help the fight against ‘self-starting’ terrorists, the Prime Minister declared: ‘We must not accept that these communications are beyond the reach of the authorities or the internet companies themselves.
But Isabella Sankey of Liberty said: ‘The ISC shamefully spins the facts, seeking to blame [websites] for not doing the agencies’ work for them.’
Response: Former MI6 director Richard Barratt said it would be 'almost impossible' and 'unfair' for  Facebook to hand over terror related activity but David Cameron claims: ‘It is their social responsibility to act on this'
In a long-awaited report, Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee yesterday said that had MI5 known about Adebowale’s messages, Fusilier Rigby’s murder could have been avoided.
And in a damning indictment of US-based tech firms, it said the same mistakes could have been made by websites run by Google, Yahoo, Apple, Twitter or Microsoft, which have become a ‘haven’ for terrorists.
