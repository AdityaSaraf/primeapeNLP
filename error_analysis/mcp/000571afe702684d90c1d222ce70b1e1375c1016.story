Club Tijuana star Juan Arango conjured memories Luis Suarez in his team's 4-3 defeat by Monterrey in the Mexican league - but it was not through prodigious scoring.
Arango had earlier curled in a magnificent free kick for his team to bring them level after falling 2-0 down early on in the encounter.
Arango spent 10 years playing in Europe, spending five seasons each at Real Mallorca in Spain and Borussia Monchengladbach in Germany.
