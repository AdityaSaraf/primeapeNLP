She has a stylist who 'buys her stuff that she likes' but she dresses herself and aspires to look like 'cool' Kylie Jenner or Miranda Kerr, who she thinks is 'sophisticated with a feminine edge to her'.
Lucy, who can be seen posing in an array of glamorous gowns in the English countryside, told MailOnline that she was honoured to be asked to work with Lipsy because she's been wearing their designs since she was 16.
Sharing her top tips for prom dressing, which she says the range is perfect for, Lucy said: 'It's so important to go for a colour that suits you because it's a moment you'll remember for the rest of your life.
In between filming and unveiling her new jewellery range, Lucy has penned her debut tome, The Dating Game, which she describes as the modern girlâ€™s no-holds-barred guide to 21st century dating, relationships and break-ups.
