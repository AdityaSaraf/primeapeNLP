Norman and Tania Smorgon initially wanted $25 million for the luxurious six bedroom abode in 750 Orrong Road Toorak, southeast Melbourne, but after multiple sales campaigns they settled for a speculated $19.2 million, reportsÂ The Age.
The sale comes in the same week as the top sale of the year for Victoria, the $23.7 million for 14 St Georges Road, in the same suburb of Toorak.
Eric Smorgman migrated from Russia to Melbourne in 1926, in a bid to escape the anti-Semitic movement headed by Stalin.
