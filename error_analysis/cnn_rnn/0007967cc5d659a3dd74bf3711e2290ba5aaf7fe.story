Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho believes Cesc Fabregas is perfectly suited to filling the position Frank Lampard occupied for 13 years .
The 27-year-old former Arsenal captain signed from Barcelona in June after Chelsea record goalscorer Lampard left under freedom of contract at the end of last season .
Fabregas scored in Chelsea &apos;s 2-1 win over Ferencvaros in Budapest on Sunday - on a day when Lampard was sitting in the stands for Manchester City after signing on loan from New York City FC - in the Blues &apos; penultimate pre-season friendly before next Monday &apos;s Premier League opening contest at Burnley .
