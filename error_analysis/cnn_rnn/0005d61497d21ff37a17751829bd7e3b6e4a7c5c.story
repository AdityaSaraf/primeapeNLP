&quot; The Arizona community can be assured that a vigorous and sophisticated legal challenge will be mounted , in advance of SB1070 &apos;s implementation , seeking to prevent this unconstitutional and discriminatory law from ever taking effect , &quot; said Thomas A.
&quot; This law will only make the rampant racial profiling of Latinos that is already going on in Arizona much worse , &quot; said Alessandra Soler Meetze , executive director of the ACLU of Arizona .
