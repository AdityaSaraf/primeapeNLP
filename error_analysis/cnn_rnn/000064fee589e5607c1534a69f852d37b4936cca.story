Sky have won the bidding war for the rights to screen Floyd Mayweather v Manny Pacquiao in the UK , as revealed by Sportsmail last Friday .
The richest fight of all time will not come cheap either — for Sky Sports or their subscribers — even though Sky are keeping faith with their core following by keeping the base price below £ 20 .
It has taken what is described by industry insiders as ‘ a very substantial offer ’ for Sky to fend off fierce competition from Frank Warren ’ s BoxNation .
