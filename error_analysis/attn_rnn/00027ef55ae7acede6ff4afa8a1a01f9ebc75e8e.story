The double Olympic champion sprinted clear of Kenyan rival Micah Kogo to cross the line in 59 minutes 32 seconds , taking 20 seconds off the mark set by Spain &apos;s Fabian Roncero 14 years ago .
Farah , who celebrates his 32nd birthday on Monday , has now set a world record and a European record in his two races so far this year .
His only race of the indoor campaign , in Birmingham last month , resulted in a new world best time over two miles and this latest success on the road suggests he is in the best possible shape ahead of a season in which he will aim to retain his 5,000 and 10,000 metres titles at the World Championships in Beijing in August .
