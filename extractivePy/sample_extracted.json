to deter , disrupt , prevent and degrade the potential for future uses of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction . &quot;\nIt &apos;s a step that is set to turn an international crisis into a fierce domestic political battle .\nThere are key questions looming over the debate : What did U.N .\nweapons inspectors find in Syria ?\nWhat happens if Congress votes no ?\nAnd how will the Syrian government react ?\nIn a televised address from the White House Rose Garden earlier Saturday , the president said he would take his case to Congress , not because he has to -- but because he wants to .\n&quot; While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization , I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course , and our actions will be even more effective , &quot; he said .\n&quot; We should have this debate , because the issues are too big for business as usual . &quot;\nObama said top congressional leaders had agreed to schedule a debate when the body returns to Washington on September 9 .\nThe Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold a hearing over the matter on Tuesday , Sen.\nRobert Menendez said .\nTranscript : Read Obama &apos;s full remarks\nSyrian crisis : Latest developments\nU.N .\ninspectors leave Syria\nObama &apos;s remarks came shortly after U.N .\ninspectors left Syria , carrying evidence that will determine whether chemical weapons were used in an attack early last week in a Damascus suburb .\n&quot;

is an assault on human dignity , &quot; the president said .\nA failure to respond with force , Obama argued , &quot; could lead to escalating use of chemical weapons or their proliferation to terrorist groups who would do our people harm .\nIn a world with many dangers , this menace must be confronted . &quot;\nSyria missile strike : What would happen next ?\nMap : U.S .\nand allied assets around Syria\nObama decision came Friday night\nOn Friday night , the president made a last-minute decision to consult lawmakers .\nWhat will happen if they vote no ?\nIt &apos;s unclear .\nA senior administration official told CNN that Obama has the authority to act without Congress -- even if Congress rejects his request for authorization to use force .\nObama on Saturday continued to shore up support for a strike on the al-Assad government .\nHe spoke by phone with French President Francois Hollande before his Rose Garden speech .\n&quot;

I understand and support Barack Obama &apos;s position on Syria , &quot; Cameron said .\nAn influential lawmaker in Russia -- which has stood by Syria and criticized the United States -- had his own theory .\n&quot; The main reason Obama is turning to the Congress : the military operation did not get enough support either in the world , among allies of the US or in the United States itself , &quot; Alexei Pushkov , chairman of the international-affairs committee of the Russian State Duma , said in a Twitter post .\nIn the United States , scattered groups of anti-war protesters around the country took to the streets Saturday .\n&quot;

embarrassed &quot; that Russia opposes military action against Syria , is &quot; crying for help &quot; for someone to come to his rescue and is facing two defeats -- on the political and military levels .\nSyria &apos;s prime minister appeared unfazed by the saber-rattling .\n&quot;

I was asked to diagnose and treat Harry to support a claim explaining why he was unable to show up in a small-claims court case , &quot; Stancheva told CNN in a phone interview .\nShe declined to cite the case or Burkhart &apos;s role in it .\nStancheva said she and other doctors including a psychiatrist diagnosed Burkhart with &quot; autism , severe anxiety , post-traumatic stress disorder and depression . &quot; The diagnosis was spelled out in a letter she wrote for the small-claims court case , Stancheva said .\nStancheva , citing doctor-patient confidentiality , would not elaborate further , nor would she identify the psychiatrist involved in the diagnosis .\nBurkhart , a 24-year-old German national , has been charged with 37 counts of arson following a string of 52 fires in Los Angeles .\nThe charges are in connection with arson fires at 12 locations scattered through Hollywood , West Hollywood and Sherman Oaks , according to authorities .\nStancheva said the refugee applications by Burkhart and his mother were denied by the Canadian government , and she has not seen Burkhart since early March of 2010 .\n&quot; I was shocked and dismayed at what happened in Los Angeles , and it appears he was not being treated for his depression , &quot; she said .\nBurkhart was in court on Wednesday for a preliminary hearing .\nProsecutors said his &quot; rage against Americans , &quot; triggered by his mother &apos;s arrest last week , motivated his &quot; campaign of terror &quot; with dozens of fires in Hollywood and nearby communities .\nBurkhart kept his eyes closed and remained limp during most of his hearing , requiring sheriff &apos;s deputies to hold him up .\nThe district attorney called his courtroom behavior &quot; very bizarre . &quot;\n&quot; This defendant has engaged in a protracted campaign in which he has set , the people believe , upwards of 52 arson fires in what essentially amounts to a campaign of terror against this community , &quot; Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Sean Carney said .\n&quot; The people believe he has engaged in this conduct because he has a hatred for Americans . &quot;\nCarney told the court Burkhart would flee the country if he was allowed out of jail on bond , but Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Upinder Kalra said he had no choice but to set bail .\nTo go free while awaiting trial , Burkhart must post a $ 2.85 million bond and surrender his German passport .\nIt was revealed that Burkhart is also under investigation for arson and fraud in relation to a fire in Neukirchen , near Frankfurt , Germany .\nThe worst arson sprees in the city &apos;s history began last Friday morning with a car fire in Hollywood that spread to apartments above a garage , but no new fires have happened since Burkhart was arrested Monday , Los Angeles District Attorney Steve Cooley said .\nNo one was hurt in the fires , but property damage costs are likely to reach $ 3 million , authorities said .\nCooley called it &quot; almost attempted murder , &quot; because people were sleeping in apartments above where Burkhart allegedly set cars on fire with incendiary devices placed under their engines .\nThe criminal complaint filed Wednesday also alleged that the fires were &quot; caused by use of a device designed to accelerate the fire , &quot; Cooley said .\n&quot; If found true , the allegation could mean additional custody time for the defendant . &quot;\n&quot; In numerous instances , the cars were parked in carports , resulting in the fires spreading to the adjacent occupied apartment buildings , &quot; a sworn affidavit from a Los Angeles arson investigator said .\n&quot; The vast majority of these fires occurred late at night when the occupants of the apartment buildings were asleep . &quot;\nInvestigator Edward Nordskog &apos;s affidavit detailed Burkhart &apos;s behavior a day before the fires began , when he was in a federal courtroom during extradition proceedings for his mother .\n&quot; While in the audience , the defendant ( Burkhart ) began yelling in an angry manner , &apos; F--k all Americans . &apos; The defendant also attempted to communicate with his mother who was in custody .\nShortly thereafter , the defendant was ejected from the courtroom by Deputy U.S .\nMarshals , &quot; Nordskog wrote .\nDorothee Burkhart was arrested a day before on an international arrest warrant issued by a district court in Frankfurt , Germany , said federal court spokesman Gunther Meilinger .\nThe 53-year-old German woman is wanted on 16 counts of fraud and three counts of embezzlement , he said .\nThe charges include an allegation that she failed to pay for a breast enhancement operation performed on her in 2004 , Meilinger said .\nMost of the German charges , however , stem from phony real estate deals that Dorothee Burkhart allegedly conducted between 2000 and 2006 .\n&quot; It is my opinion that the defendant &apos;s criminal spree was motivated by his rage against Americans and that by setting these fires the defendant intended to harm and terrorize as many residents of the city and county of Los Angeles as possible , &quot; Nordskog wrote .\nA search of Burkhart &apos;s Hollywood apartment found newspaper clippings about the Los Angeles fires and articles from Germany reporting similar car fires in Frankfurt , Germany in September , 2011 , the investigator said .\n&quot; It is my opinion based on my experience that it is highly likely the defendant has a history of setting arson fires in Germany before he came to the United States , &quot; Nordskog wrote .\nBurkhart &apos;s mother is scheduled for another extradition hearing Friday , while he is due back in court for arraignment on January 24 .\nMeanwhile , both Burkharts are housed in a Los Angeles jail .", "labels": "1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0", "summaries": "NEW : A Canadian doctor says she was part of a team examining Harry Burkhart in 2010\nNEW : Diagnosis : &quot;

Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Director Phil Anderson said in a release .\n&apos;We believe this area may merit additional restrictions to enhance the traditional uses of this popular beach.&apos;\nHunting octopus is legal in Central Puget Sound , with a maximum catch of one per day .\nBut on October 31st , the sight of Dylan Mayer punching and beating the 30-pound female on shore before throwing it in his truck bed and driving off easily unnerved many residents .\n&apos;As they were coming in you could tell the octopus was alive .\nIt was writhing around and they were wrestling with it , &apos;

he said according to a WDFW release that reported him signing the petition as well .\nThe new Marine Protected Area in Central Puget Sound will require the commission &apos;s vote for the new protected area and could take months .\nFood ?\nMr Mayer said he planned to eat to octopus and that catching it was no different than catching an eating a fish\nLegal : Game wardens said the catch was completely legal and that the diver was within his rights to harvest the animal\nAmong their considerations are designating Seacrest Park as a marine protected area or prohibiting hunting the animals anywhere in the state .\nAngry fellow divers from the shore took\nphotographs of Mayer proudly standing with the large octopus and then\nwatched in disbelief as he and his friend tossed the still live 30 pound\nfemale onto the bed of his truck before driving off .\nTheir shock turned to horror as a\ngrinning Mayer posted images of himself measuring the now dead octopus\nonto his Facebook account and now is in the position of having to\njustify to the diving community why he hunted the gentle and intelligent\nanimal .\n&apos;I eat it for meat .\nIt &apos;s no different than fishing .\nIt &apos;s just a different animal , &apos;

said avid diver Drew Collins .\nThe uproar caused by Mayer has led to the 19-year-old receiving dozens of threatening phone calls and abusive emails .\nThe wannabe rescue diver has said that he has been demonized by the local scuba community and has had to deny claims that the octopus was sitting on eggs when he captured her .\n&apos;That &apos;s not true .\nThere were no eggs under it , and we checked , &apos;

said Wendy Willette .\n&apos;It &apos;s like deer hunting .\nYou don &apos;t kill a deer while kids are viewing it , and I think it &apos;s a similar problem here .\nYou need to be sensitive to other drivers and people if you &apos;re going to be a sportsman.&apos;\nIndeed , Mayer told Komo News that he has now been banned from several diver shops in the Seattle area because of the octopus hunt .\nHe said that his dream of becoming a rescue-diver is in jeopardy because he has been banned from several diving schools because of his actions .\nWatch the video here :", "labels": "0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0", "summaries": "Once octopus-hunter Dylan Mayer has now also signed a petition of 5,000 divers banning their hunt at Seacrest Park\nDecision by Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife could take months"}

manor &apos; where Ettington Hall stands for almost a thousand years .\nSo evocative is the family history that William Shakespeare , an occasional house-guest at Ettington Park , wrote gushingly about &apos; the spirit of valiant Shirley &apos; .\nToday , some 400 years later , talk of that &apos; valiant &apos; spirit brings a wry smile to the lips of local people .\nFor Philip Shirley finds himself at the centre of a very public skirmish .\nIt revolves around some six acres of farmland that he owns on the edge of Ettington , a couple of miles from the family seat .\nThis site \u2014 a field crossed by a well-trodden footpath , with views of the Cotswold Hills \u2014 is the subject of a fierce planning dispute .\nShirley , in partnership with a building company , plans to develop it to create several dozen &apos; executive &apos; homes .\nIll-feeling over the proposal has united the local community in opposition .\nMore than 400 people \u2014 one for every house in Ettington \u2014 have filed written objections to it .\nMany see it as emblematic of a wider national malaise .\nFor as the Campaign to Protect Rural England ( CPRE ) revealed this week , a staggering 729,000 homes are to be built on greenfield sites such as this .\nAlmost 200,000 of those will be on supposedly protected Green Belt land .\nThe front view of Ettington Park , which sits on the banks of the river Stour in the heart of Shakespeare country\nThe battle has not just divided the village but caused tensions among the members of Shirley &apos;s immediate family .\nIndeed , I understand that his wife , Augusta , is vehemently opposed to the development .\nThe trouble here began last year , when Philip Shirley struck a multi-million-pound deal to allow a developer , Charles Church Homes , to build 80 homes on the field , which has been in his family for generations .\nLocals , when they found out in September , were outraged by the project , which would increase the size of the pretty village , which has two pubs and one shop , by a fifth .\nThey held angry public meetings , signed petitions , met politicians .\nAfter a planning application was submitted last month , they began bombarding Stratford-upon-Avon &apos;s district council with complaints .\nThe village is dominated by banners and signs opposing the proposed estate , claiming that it will increase traffic , destroy a well-used footpath and place an intolerable strain on the local school .\n&apos;It &apos;s the scale that is so outrageous , &apos; says Sally Rawles , the leader of SHAPE , a lobby group with 200 local members opposing the development .\n&apos;Stratford council have said our village should have no more than 50 new homes between now and 2031 .\n&apos;This will give us 80 in one go , in a highly visible spot .\nIt will rip the heart out of our community .\nIt just makes my blood boil.&apos;\nMuch personal anger is directed at Philip Shirley himself .\n&apos;We never thought the Shirleys would do something like this , &apos; says Mary-Ann Warmington , 56 , whose grandmother , a parlourmaid , was one of many locals who worked at Ettington Park .\nEttington residents against the proposed development in the village .\nSally Rawles , left , Louise Whiteley and Simon Pipe are pictured in the foreground\n&apos;They have always run the village so we never thought they would do something to ruin it , especially when they already have so much money .\nI feel betrayed.&apos;\nHostilities nearly spilled over at the White Horse pub last month when SHAPE held a quiz night to raise funds to oppose the development .\nAugusta Shirley had agreed to attend the event as a guest of James Holloway , a local agent for the Conservative Party .\nHowever , a few hours before it began she was advised not to attend due to the &apos; level of hostility &apos; her presence might generate .\nAn organiser tells me : &apos; It was for her own safety .\nPeople are really livid.&apos;\nI understand that Mr Shirley has not actually sold the field yet , but instead granted Charles Church Homes a legally binding &apos; option &apos; to buy it , for several million pounds , provided planning permission is granted .\nBut details of the deal are hard to ascertain .\nWhen a local newspaper got wind of it , Mr Shirley not only refused to comment but even refused to confirm that he owned the field .\nLand Registry documents confirm that it belongs to a family trust based in the Isle of Man for tax purposes .\nHe did not respond to the Mail &apos;s requests for comment .\n&apos;A lot of this is about class , &apos; said a source close to the family .\n&apos;People always want to blame the landowner , but new homes have to go somewhere and half of these villagers who so oppose the development live on an estate built 15 years ago .\nThat makes them hypocrites as well as NIMBYs .\n&apos;If they owned a field and were offered a chance to turn it into a few million quid , I bet they &apos;d accept.&apos;\nWhen I called at the farmhouse where the Shirley family live ( these days they lease Ettington Park to a luxury hotel chain ) , Augusta also declined to discuss the affair .\nThe area &apos;s Tory MP , Nadhim Zahawi , who backs the project &apos;s opponents\nHowever , a friend of Mrs Shirley told me that her sympathies lie with the villagers .\nShe was said to be &apos; very cross &apos; about her husband &apos;s decision and &apos; feels passionately &apos; that planning permission should be refused .\n&apos;Philip signed this silly deal without telling Augusta .\nHe &apos;s a greedy clot for doing it and she is very , very cross about it , &apos; said the friend .\nSir William Stratford Dugdale , Mr Shirley &apos;s uncle , is a wealthy businessman married to David Cameron &apos;s aunt Cecilia , although friends deny that the landowner has a close relationship with the PM .\n&apos;I believe two branches of the family fell out years ago when Philip , or one of his close relatives , wasn &apos;t invited to David Cameron &apos;s fifth birthday party .\nPetty though it seems , they &apos;ve barely spoken since .\nSome extended family members now won &apos;t vote Conservative , &apos; says one .\nAs regards the planning battle , though , similar disputes are playing out across rural Britain thanks to the housing boom , a loophole in planning regulations and the incompetence of more than half of our local authorities .\nIn at least eight villages around Stratford-upon-Avon , developments of between 20 and 100 homes are mooted .\nLocals are calling it &apos; a battle for Shakespeare country &apos; .\nSome of the building applications go back to 2010 , when the Government altered planning law to require every local authority to create a &apos; core strategy &apos; outlining where an allotted number of new homes should be built in the coming years .\nIt was decreed that , if no such plan was in place , home-builders who were refused planning permission for a project but appealed against that decision to central government would be likely to gain automatic consent .\nThe rule was supposed to encourage local government bureaucrats to create housing plans promptly .\nBut three years after it came into operation , 178 of the country &apos;s 327 district councils still haven &apos;t managed to complete their &apos; core strategy &apos; \u2014 temporarily giving developers carte blanche to build on almost any rural land they can buy .\nAs the CPRE revealed this week , 38 major developments , involving 8,700 new homes , were given the green light on appeal last year .\nMost were in the constituencies of Tory MPs , leading some to wonder if anger over the issue could cost the party marginal seats at next year &apos;s election .\n&apos;There are lots of Tory landowners benefiting from this planning loophole , &apos; says Sally Rawles .\n&apos;They all have connections to the party and many of them are donors.&apos;\nWhich is awkward for the area &apos;s Tory MP , Nadhim Zahawi , who backs the project &apos;s opponents .\nThe other day Mr Zahawi , a No 10 policy adviser , published an open letter to the Government calling for the loophole to be closed .\nIt declared that the &apos; physical harm &apos; being done by &apos; rapacious developers &apos; threatens &apos; to become the defining legacy of this Government &apos; .\nHe had a point .\nFor the longer the loophole remains open , the angrier the voters of Ettington , and many other villages , will surely get .", "labels": "1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0", "summaries": "Philip Shirley finds himself at the centre of a very public skirmish\nHe is one of the most impeccably bred landowners in the country\nBut ill-feeling over the proposal has united locals in opposition"}

\u2014 and still does .\nFor as long as I can remember I have consistently blushed bright pink at the slightest provocation .\nIn fact , to say that I am easily embarrassed is something of an understatement .\nEven now \u2014 as a grown woman of 62 \u2014 I only have to get slightly anxious to flush a bright shade of fuchsia .\nIf anyone makes a flattering remark , I blush ; if they make an unflattering one , I blush , and if I do something silly , of course , I blush .\nScroll down for video\nFor as long as Linda Kelsey can remember she has consistently blushed bright pink at the slightest provocation .\nAccording to a recent study , we embarrass ourselves as many as seven times per week and women feel embarrassed three times more often than men .\nBut seven times per week doesn \u2019 t sound that often to me \u2014 I blush profusely at least once a day .\nOn Tuesday , I managed to clock up two embarrassing moments before lunch .\nIn the morning I spent five minutes searching for my glasses .\n\u2018 I just don \u2019 t know where they \u2019 ve got to , \u2019 I moaned , only to have my partner point out that not only was I wearing them but I had another pair perched on my head !\nCue redness .\nWhile most little girls love pink , pink was Linda &apos;s least favourite colour growing up because it reminded her of the colour of my face\nThen in my local cafe , I bumped into an old flame I hadn \u2019 t seen since school .\nDespite me having unwashed hair and no make-up , he recognised me and announced cheerily : \u2018 I was hopelessly in love with you when I was 14 . \u2019 My hand instantly flew up to cover the pinky-hue I could feel spreading across my cheeks .\nMost people eventually stop going red when they get older , mainly because their confidence grows and they learn how to deal with embarrassing situations better .\nFor those of us who continue to be afflicted , blushing in itself remains a lifelong embarrassment .\nAccording to clinical psychologist Professor Robert Bor , author of Coping Successfully With Shyness , we get embarrassed because of a sense of either actual or impending shame , as well as a fear of unwarranted attention .\n\u2018 It kicks off an immediate physical reaction with a heightened state of arousal or adrenaline rush , \u2019 he explains .\n\u2018 You \u2019 re not in control of this physical response and you may turn red as a result .\nOther responses can include a dry mouth and racing heart . \u2019\nNot everyone who feels embarrassment blushes , but chronic blushers sometimes become so fearful of blushing that they begin to lead a hermit-like existence , avoiding social situations entirely .\nAlthough the survey suggests women feel embarrassed three times as often as men , Professor Robert Edelmann , author of Coping With Blushing , thinks it would be wrong to conclude that women suffer embarrassment more than men .\n\u2018 Women tend to score higher than men on most levels of anxiety , \u2019 he says .\n\u2018 But this could be because women are more willing to admit they have negative feelings and find it easier to talk about their problems than men do . \u2019\nJust why some people are more easily embarrassed than others may be partly genetic and partly learned ( stock picture )\nJust why some people are more easily embarrassed than others may be partly genetic and partly learned .\n\u2018 If your parents are shy you may inherit that tendency , or perhaps you just pick up on their way of behaving , \u2019 says Professor Bor .\nCertainly , my own mother was especially timid , while my dad was an outgoing charmer .\nWhen I look at old photos of my mother she \u2019 s always posing with her head slightly at an angle and eyes slightly away from the direct gaze of the camera , as if mildly embarrassed .\nRather like the pose Princess Diana struck in early pictures .\nAn easily embarrassed child , it seems , can turn even a positive situation into a negative .\nProfessor Bor gives the example of a bright student who knows the answer to a question asked by a teacher in class but won \u2019 t put up his or her hand because then everyone else will look at them .\nA blush doesn \u2019 t just show on your face \u2014 your stomach lining also turns red\nThat \u2019 s exactly why I kept schtum throughout my childhood and hated being picked out for special attention .\nI was worried I would get teased for being the clever one .\nIn the same way , an easily embarrassed adult might be enjoying their birthday party only to feel horribly exposed when everyone sings Happy Birthday .\nI enjoy celebrating my birthday but singing and speeches are strictly forbidden .\nNot everyone who is shy needs professional help , but if embarrassment is inhibiting you from getting on with your life \u2014 from forming relationships , progressing in your career or simply from going out and having fun \u2014 help is available .\nAccording to Professor Bor , modern psychological methods for dealing with social anxiety and embarrassment offer some of the most successful and rapid treatments of all .\nLinda often uses a green-tinged face cream under foundation to counteract redness , but would only consider surgery if blushing was preventing her from getting on with her life\nA few sessions of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy ( CBT ) , a therapy based on the idea that unhelpful and unrealistic thinking leads to negative behaviour , can give a big confidence boost \u2014 and blushing the boot .\nThere \u2019 s also hope in the form of an operation , endoscopic transthoracic sympathectomy , which destroys the nerve responsible for facial blushing .\nSome 200 operations to cure blushing are done every year on the NHS , with a 90 per cent success rate .\nBut one of the main risks is compensatory excess sweating , which can be as difficult to deal with as the initial problem .\nSome 200 operations to cure blushing are done every year on the NHS ( stock picture )\nSo how do you overcome your propensity to turn pink if you don \u2019 t want to resort to surgery ?\nWhile I often use a green-tinged face cream under foundation to counteract redness , I \u2019 d only consider surgery if blushing was preventing me from getting on with my life .\nProfessor Bor says the secret is to force yourself to cope in embarrassing situations and that \u2019 s how I \u2019 ve managed to get by .\nSo I accept invitations to public-speaking engagements and am interviewed on radio and TV \u2014 even though I really don \u2019 t want to .\nFor those of us who despair of our constant blushing , there is some comfort to be gained from recent research that proves embarrassment can be a good thing .\nStudies from the University of California , Berkeley , have shown that people who display embarrassment when describing embarrassing moments are regarded as more co-operative and trustworthy than those who show pride .\nProfessor Edelmann says : \u2018 Blushing shows you have a degree of humility , and that can be attractive .\nThat perhaps explains why no woman \u2019 s make-up is ever complete without a dab of blusher to give her a slight pink glow . \u2019\nI \u2019 ve lived with my blushing for so long now that I \u2019 ve almost come to accept it .\nI know that when my partner grabs me for a kiss in the park , I will blush and pull away , even though I \u2019 m thrilled .\nThat when I am about to introduce someone and have forgotten their name \u2014 which happens all the time \u2014 I will blush
